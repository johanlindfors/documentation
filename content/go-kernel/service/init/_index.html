<p>
    The first lifecycle stage a service goes through is init.
    Here a service can declare any other services it has a dependency on or any command line flags it requires.
</p>
<p>
    To do this the service needs to implement the InitialisableService interface:
</p>
{{< highlight go "linenos=inline" >}}type InitialisableService interface {
    Init(*Kernel) error
}{{< / highlight >}}

<p>
    If an error is returned from this Init() method the Kernel will exit immediately returning that error.
</p>

<div class="alert-danger">
    <p>
        A service must never call a function in another service from inside the Init() method,
        nor create any external resources like go routines or open files.
    </p>
    <p>
        Doing so could call a service which has not yet been initialised and leave resources open if the kernel exits
        due to an error.
    </p>
</div>

<h2>Command line flags</h2>
<p>
    To add a simple flag to a service we simply use the flag package to create the flag from within the
    Init function.
</p>
{{< highlight go "linenos=inline" >}}package hugo

import (
  "flag"
  "github.com/peter-mount/documentation/tools/util"
  "github.com/peter-mount/go-kernel"
)

// Hugo runs hugo
type Hugo struct {
  server *bool // true to run Hugo in server mode
}

func (h *Hugo) Name() string {
  return "hugo"
}

func (h *Hugo) Init(_ *kernel.Kernel) error {
  h.server = flag.Bool("s", false, "Run hugo in server mode")
  return nil
}{{< / highlight >}}
<p>
    Once the kernel has completed the Init stage we can then reference the flag's value as it would be set with
    the command line flag from the command line.
</p>
</div>

<div style="break-inside: avoid">

<h2>Service dependencies</h2>
<p>
    A service can declare a dependency against another service by using the Kernel instance passed to the Init method.
    The passed instance is only valid for this call, and you should never store it or attempt to use it outside of
    the Init lifecycle stage.
</p>

<p>
    There are two types of dependencies. The most common one is where you want to use one service from another.
    To do this you need to use the AddService() function in the Kernel instance passed to Init().
</p>
{{< highlight go >}}func (k *Kernel) AddService(s Service) (Service, error){{< / highlight >}}
<p>
    This function accepts a single instance of the service you require. The function will then either return the
    instance the service that's been deployed in the kernel which you can then cast and store for later use.
</p>
<p>
    If an error occurs then AddService() will return that error.
    You must exit the Init() function immediately, returning that error.
</p>

<p>For example:</p>

{{< highlight go "linenos=inline" >}}package hugo

import (
  "context"
  "github.com/peter-mount/go-kernel"
)

type Webserver struct {
  config *Config      // Config
}

func (w *Webserver) Name() string {
  return "webserver"
}

func (w *Webserver) Init(k *kernel.Kernel) error {
  service, err := k.AddService(&Config{})
  if err != nil {
    return err
  }
  w.config = service.(*Config)

  return nil
}{{< / highlight >}}

<p>
    The instance you pass to AddService() may not be the same one returned if that service already exists in the kernel.
</p>
<p>
    The key here is the string the Name() function returns.
    As that must be unique it is used as the unique identifier within the kernel for the service.
</p>
    <p>
        As such the lookup follows the following rules:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>If it already exists then the existing entry will be returned.</li>
        <li>If it does not exist then the kernel will perform the following in sequence:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    If the new Service implements InitialisableService then it's Init() function will be called
                    so that it can add its own dependencies which will then deploy before it.
                </li>
                <li>The new service is finally added to the kernel and the instance you passed to the function will be returned.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If the kernel has a service with the same name defined but of a different type then the cast will cause a
        panic stopping the kernel.
    </p>
</div>

<div style="break-before: page">

    <h2>Unreferenced Service dependencies</h2>
    <p>
        The Kernel instance has a second function available, DependsOn().
        This is rarely used but is a convenience function where you declare that you depend on one or more services
        to exist but don't actually want a reference to them.
    </p>
{{< highlight go >}}func (k *Kernel) DependsOn(services ...Service) error{{< / highlight >}}
    <p>
        For example, you might have a service that requires a webserver to be running, but you don't need to directly
        link to it as you would be making http calls to it instead.
    </p>
{{< highlight go "linenos=inline" >}}package pdf

import (
  "github.com/peter-mount/documentation/tools/hugo"
  "github.com/peter-mount/go-kernel"
)

// PDF tool that handles the generation of PDF documentation of a "book"
type PDF struct {
  config   *hugo.Config   // Config
  chromium *hugo.Chromium // Chromium browser
}

func (p *PDF) Name() string {
  return "PDF"
}

func (p *PDF) Init(k *kernel.Kernel) error {
  service, err := k.AddService(&hugo.Config{})
  if err != nil {
    return err
  }
  p.config = service.(*hugo.Config)

  service, err = k.AddService(&hugo.Chromium{})
  if err != nil {
    return err
  }
  p.chromium = service.(*hugo.Chromium)

  // We need a webserver & must run after hugo
  return k.DependsOn(&hugo.Webserver{}, &hugo.Hugo{})
}{{< / highlight >}}
    <p>
        Here we depend on two services which we store a reference to use them,
        but we also require two others to be deployed and started before this service.
    </p>
    <p>
        If an error occurs then DependsOn() will return that error. You must exit Init() returning that error.
    </p>
</div>

<div style="break-inside: avoid">
    <h2>Circular dependencies</h2>
    <p>
        The kernel does not allow circular dependencies.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example you have three services called A, B and C.
    </p>
    <p>
        Service A depends on B which in turn depends on C.
    </p>
    <p>
        However Service B cannot depend on A, nor can C depend on either A or B because the kernel would not be able to
        determine the order the services should be started.
    </p>
    <p>
        e.g. if C depends on A, but A indirectly depends on C via B which one should start first?
    </p>
    <p>
        If this situation happens during a call to AddService() or DependsOn() the kernel itself will stop returning
        an error.
    </p>

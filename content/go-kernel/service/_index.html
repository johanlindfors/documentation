    <p>
        A Service is the core entity managed by the microkernel which will provide it with lifecycle support and dependency management.
    </p>
    <p>
        It consists of a struct type which implements the Service interface and optionally any of the lifecycle interfaces.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the bare minimum the Service interface must be implemented.
    </p>
{{< highlight go "linenos=inline" >}}type Service interface {
    Name() string
}{{< / highlight >}}
    <p>
        The Name() function must return a unique identifier for your service.
        Usually this can be the services name, just as long as it's unique with any other services deployed within the
        kernel.
    </p>
    <p>For Example, a bare minimal Service can be defined</p>
{{< highlight go "linenos=inline" >}}type MyService struct {
}

func (s *MyService) Name() string {
    return "MyService
}{{< / highlight >}}
    <p>
        With this basic definition this new service can now be deployed into the kernel.
        As this example has no lifecycle functions defined the kernel will just deploy it and make it available to
        any service that requires access to it.
    </p>

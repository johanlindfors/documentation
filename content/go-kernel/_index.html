    <p>
        go-kernel is a simple microkernel which can run multiple services within the same go runtime.
        The kernel provides both lifecycle support for those services and dependency management
        so that services start and stop in the correct order.
    </p>

    <h2>Kernel lifecycle</h2>
    <p>
        When the kernel.Launch() function is called it starts an instance of the microkernel, then goes through each
        stage of its lifecycle.
        It exits when either the entire sequence has completed or if a service fails part way though, at which point it
        will
        return the error the failed service has returned.
    </p>
    <p>
        The following is an overview of this sequence.
        The details of each stage is described in full under the Services section of the documentation, however a
        Service does not have to implement any of them, they are all optional.
    </p>

    <table>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th style="vertical-align: top;">
                Init
            </th>
            <td>
                <p>
                    This is the initial stage. Here services can declare they depend on other services by implementing
                    the InitialisableService. They can also define any command line flags they want to use.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once this stage completes no new services can be added to the kernel.
                </p>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th style="vertical-align: top;">
                PostInit
            </th>
            <td>
                <p>
                    The second stage which allows a service to check it has everything it needs.
                    Usually this is to check that any command line flags are valid or mandatory ones are present.
                </p>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th style="vertical-align: top;">
                Start
            </th>
            <td>
                <p>
                    The third stage is Start. A service can implement the StartableService interface so that it can
                    perform any initialisation it requires.
                    For example, it could load a configuration file, open a database.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once a service has started it can be safely used by any dependents.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If a service fails to start the kernel will skip to the Stop stage to stop any previously started
                    service before exiting with the error of the failure.
                </p>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th style="vertical-align: top;">
                Run
            </th>
            <td>
                <p>
                    When the kernel reaches the run stage, every service has now been started.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The kernel will then go though every deployed service and if they implement the RunnableService
                    interface it will the Run function. If that function returns an error then the kernel will stop
                    and enter the Stop stage to stop any previously started service before exiting with the error of
                    the failure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Be aware that it is possible for a single service to never exit from this stage.
                    An example of this is the rest web server service provided by the kernel.
                    As this has to run forever the RunnableService implementation never returns keeping the application
                    running.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For this reason the RunnableService interface is usually used for command line tools.
                    For Server Daemons like a rest service this interface should not be used as you cannot guarantee
                    it will ever be called.
                </p>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th style="vertical-align: top;">
                Stop
            </th>
            <td>
                <p>
                    This is the final stage where every service that implements the StoppableService interface that has
                    also passed through the Start stage will have their Stop function called.
                    This allows a service to release any resources it has open.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note: this will call those services in reverse order.
                    Specifically, the most recently started service will be stopped first.
                    This is done so that services are stopped in the correct sequence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, a StoppableService does not need to implement StartableService.
                    It is perfectly fine to implement just Stop() and not Start().
                </p>
                <p>
                    This stage can be invoked at various stages:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>When a service's Start() method returns an error</li>
                    <li>When a service's Run() method returns an error</li>
                    <li>When the Run stage completes</li>
                    <li>The process receives a SIGINT(2) or SIGTERM(15) signal</li>
                </ol>
            </td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

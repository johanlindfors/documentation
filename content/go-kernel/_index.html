    <p>
        go-kernel is a simple microkernel which can run multiple services within the same go runtime.
        The kernel provides both lifecycle support for those services and dependency management
        so that services start and stop in the correct order.
    </p>
    <p>
        To create an application requires a simple bootstrap which contains the core Service's that are required to
        run the application.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, this site is generated with a microkernel based application and it uses a bootstrap similar to the
        following:
    </p>
    {{< highlight go "linenos=table" >}}package main

import (
  "github.com/peter-mount/documentation/tools/hugo"
  "github.com/peter-mount/documentation/tools/pdf"
  "github.com/peter-mount/go-kernel"
  "log"
)

func main() {
  err := kernel.Launch(
    &hugo.Hugo{},
    &pdf.PDF{},
  )
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
  }
}
{{< / highlight >}}
    <p>
        Here it defines two services which must be started.
        Each one is declared by passing an empty instance of the
    </p>
    <p>
        The order they are listed here will be used to determine which one starts first, although this can be affected
        by any dependencies on earlier services. This is covered in the lifecycle section of the documentation.

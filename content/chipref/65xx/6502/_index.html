        <td>Address Bus</td>
        <td>
            The sixteen bit Address Bus formed by A0-A15, address memory and I/O registers that exchange data on the Data Bus.
            The address lines can be set to the high impedance state by the Bus Enable (BE) signal.
        </td>

    <tr>
        <td>BE</td>
        <td>Bus Enable</td>
        <td>
            The Bus Enable (BE) input signal provides external control of the Address, Data and the RWB buffers.
            When Bus Enable is high, the Address, Data and RWB buffers are active.
            When BE is low, these buffers are set to the high impedance status.
            Bus Enable is an asynchronous signal.

    <tr>
        <td><span class="not">IRQ</span></td>
        <td>Interrupt Request</td>
        <td>
            The processor initiates it's interrupt sequence when the <span class="not">IRQ</span> line is pulled low.
            The <span class="not">IRQ</span> signal should be held low until the interrupt handler clears the interrupt request source.

        <td>
            The Memory Lock (<span class="not">ML</span>) output may be used to ensure the integrity of Read-Modify-Write instructions in a multiprocessor system.
            Memory Lock indicates the need to defer arbitration of the bus cycle when <span class="not">ML</span> is low.
            Memory Lock is low during the last three cycles of ASL, DEC, INC, LSR, ROL, ROR, TRB, and TSB memory referencing instructions.

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><span class="not">NMI</span></td>
        <td>Non-Maskable Interrupt</td>
        <td>
            A negative transition on the Non-Maskable Interrupt (<span class="not">NMI</span>) input initiates an interrupt sequence after the current instruction is completed.
            Since <span class="not">NMI</span> is an edge-sensitive input, an interrupt will occur if there is a negative transition while servicing a previous interrupt.
            Also, after the edge interrupt occurs no further interrupts will occur if <span class="not">NMI</span> remains low.

            Phase<sub>2</sub> or ∅<sub>2</sub> is the system clock input.
            ∅<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;(Out) is generated from the ∅<sub>2</sub> input.
            ∅<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;(Out) is the inverted ∅<sub>2</sub> signal.

        <td>Read/Write</td>
        <td>
            The R/<span class="not">W</span> signal is used to control data transfer.
            When it's in the high state the processor is reading memory.
            When it's in the low state the Data Bus contains valid data to be written to the memory address.
            The R/<span class="not">W</span> signal is set to a high impedance state wheh Bus Enable is low.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>RDY</td>
        <td>Ready</td>
        <td>
            A low signal on RDY will halt the processor in its current state.
            Returning to high signal will restart the processor on the next PHI<sub>2</sub> negative transition.
            The WAI instruction (65C02 &amp; later) will pull RDY low.
            If RDY is not used a pull-up resistor is recommended as newer processors no longer have an active pull-up.

            Initialise the microprocessor.
            The <span class="not">RES</span> pin must be held low for at least 2 clock cycles after V<sub>DD</sub>
            reaches operating voltage.
            Ready (RDY) has no effect whilst <span class="not">RES</span> is low.
            When a positive edge is detected on <span class="not">RES</span> the processor will begin a reset sequence which is 7 cycles long.

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><span class="not">SO</span></td>
        <td>Set Overflow</td>
        <td>
            A negative transition on the <span class="not">SO</span> pin sets the overflow bit in the status register.

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>SYNC</td>
        <td>Synchronize with OpCode fetch</td>
        <td>
            The SYNC line is high when the processor is reading an instruction from memory (not whilst reading data).
            If the RDY line is pulled low during the same clock cycle as SYNC is high the processor will stop & remain
            stopped until RDY goes high. This can be used to implement hardware single instruction execution.

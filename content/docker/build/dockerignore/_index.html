    <p>
        One feature that is widely ignored is <code>.dockerignore</code>
        but implementing this can speed up your builds by limiting what is sent
        to docker before the build starts.
    </p>
    <p>
        The format of <code>.dockerignore</code> is pretty simple &amp; is documented
        <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#dockerignore-file" target="_blank">here</a>
        but it can be pretty basic.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, this site is built by a docker container however we only need two directories &amp; a single file
        to be passed to docker to perform the build so our <code>.dockerignore</code> is pretty basic:
    </p>
{{< highlight go "linenos=inline" >}}
*
!bin
!tools
!go.mod
{{< / highlight >}}
    <p>
        Here we first exclude everything then add exclusion rules to include the bin &amp; tools directories and the
        go.mod file.
        The speed improvement is noticeable. For this site it's currently 300MB but with those 3 simple lines only
        207KB is sent to docker.
    </p>
    <p>
        You'll note that Dockerfile isn't passed to the build context as it's not needed there.
        It's actually advised to never send it to the build context, something most dev's don't realise.

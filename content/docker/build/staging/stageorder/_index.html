    <p>
        One common issue with complex Dockerfiles is that your final image might require
        additional packages installed. If this is a lot it can slow down your build.
    </p>
    <p>
        A technique here is to break up your final image, create a stage early on in
        your Dockerfile which prepares the final image, installing any required
        packages, then your compilation stages.
    </p>
    <p>
        The last stage will be based on the first stage and installs your build
        artefacts.
    </p>
    <p>
        The benefit of this is that whilst you are developing your image the first
        stages are cached by docker, so unless something changes they don't get
        run again and later stages then use the cache.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example:
    </p>
{{< highlight go "linenos=inline" >}}
FROM debian:11-slim AS base
WORKDIR /root
RUN apt-get update &&\
    apt-get install -y ca-certificates chromium nodejs npm &&\
    npm install npm@latest -g &&\
    npm install -g postcss postcss-cli &&\
    npm install autoprefixer &&\
    chmod -R +rx /root &&\
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* /tmp/* /var/tmp/* ~/.npmrc

FROM golang:alpine AS build
RUN apk add --no-cache tzdata

WORKDIR /work

RUN go env -w GOFLAGS=-mod=mod
COPY go.mod .
RUN go mod download

COPY src/ src/
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o /dest/exampleapp src/bin/main.go

FROM base AS final
COPY --from=build /dest/* /usr/local/bin/
WORKDIR /work
{{< / highlight >}}
    <p>
        Here we now have three stages:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Lines 1&hellip;9 is the first stage based on <code>debian:11-slim</code> and we install
            chromium and nodejs.
        </li>
        <li>
            Lines 11&hellip;21 is the second stage, which compiles our application using go.
        </li>
        <li>
            Lines 23&hellip;25 is the third and last stage forming our final image.
            Here it uses the first stage as the base and just copies the built application from the
            second stage into /usr/local/bin
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The main benefit here is that if you change something in the source, only those steps after the
        <code>COPY src/ src/</code> line will be run, everything else is in the cache.
    </p>

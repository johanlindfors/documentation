    <p>
        One common pattern developers use for a Dockerfile is do everything at once.
        This might be fine for simple images but if you are compiling the application then
        this is bad as you can easily bloat the final image with either the source code
        or even the compilers needed to build but not to run.
    </p>
    <p>
        The solution to this is to use stages.
        Here you break up your build into separate stages.
        The earlier stages do the compiling of your application whilst the
        last one contains your application.
    </p>
    <p>
        The last stage always becomes the final built image.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example:
    </p>
{{< highlight go "linenos=inline" >}}
FROM golang:alpine AS build
RUN apk add --no-cache tzdata

WORKDIR /work

RUN go env -w GOFLAGS=-mod=mod
COPY go.mod .
RUN go mod download

COPY src/ src/
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o /dest/exampleapp src/bin/main.go

FROM debian:11-slim AS final
COPY --from=build /dest/* /usr/local/bin/
WORKDIR /work
{{< / highlight >}}
    <p>
        Here we have two stages:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Lines 1&hellip;11 is the first stage, and it uses the <code>golang:alpine</code> image to compile an example
            application which it stores the built binary under the /dest/ directory.
        </li>
        <li>
            Lines 13&hellip;15 is the second and last stage.
            It uses the <code>debian:11-slim</code> image, copies the built application from the
            first stage into /usr/local/bin
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The final image is now a lot smaller as it doesn't have any of the compilers installed.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is a simple example of build staging.
        There are other techniques you can use with this like ordering stages and
        intermediate stages to reduce the number of layers.

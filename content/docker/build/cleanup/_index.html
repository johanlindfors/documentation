  <p>
    When docker performs a built it caches each generated layer so that subsequent builds
    run faster as, if a layer has not changed and all earlier layers in the Dockerfile were taken
    from the cache then it will reuse that layer.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is brilliant during development, but it can end up filling your disk due to old layers occupying space.
  </p>
  <p>
    To solve this you need to periodically clean up old unused layers.
  </p>

  <h2>Manual process</h2>
  <p>
    The easiest way is to run the following commands every so often.
    These will remove any image not in active use by a running container.
  </p>
{{< highlight go "linenos=inline" >}}
docker container prune -f
docker image prune --all -f
{{< / highlight >}}

  <h2>Automatic process</h2>
  <p>
    The better way, more so if you run dedicated build hosts, is to set up a crontab to
    perform the cleanup periodically.
  </p>
  <p>
    The following crontab is what I use.
  </p>
{{< highlight go "linenos=inline" >}}
50 * * * * docker container prune -f --filter "until=4h"
55 * * * * docker image prune --all -f --filter "until=4h"
59 * * * * docker volume prune -f
{{< / highlight >}}
  <p>
    It runs every hour and removes any container or image if they are unused and are older than 4 hours old.
    This works well on both dedicated build servers and my local machine.

  <p>
    One cause of bloated images is where additional packages are required to a base image.
    The developer will install them as they would on a real system not realising that the
    downloaded packages are being cached and get included in the final image.
  </p>
  <p>
    The solution to this is pretty simple, either tell the package manager not to cache
    them or ensure the package installation files are removed once installation has been completed.
  </p>

  <h2>Alpine</h2>
  <p>
    When using the <code>alpine</code> base images, or images based on it, you can simply
    tell the <code>apk</code> command not to cache by passing the <code>--no-cache</code> parameter:
  </p>
{{< highlight go "linenos=inline" >}}
FROM golang:alpine as build

RUN apk add --no-cache curl git tzdata zip
{{< / highlight >}}

  <h2>Debian/Ubuntu</h2>
  <p>
    For images that use <code>apt</code> or <code>apt-get</code> it's a little bit more complicated.
    Here you need to do an update first, install and then finally remove the packages in the same command:
  </p>
{{< highlight go "linenos=inline" >}}
FROM debian:11-slim
RUN apt-get update &&\
    apt-get install -y ca-certificates chromium nodejs npm &&\
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* /tmp/* /var/tmp/*
{{< / highlight >}}
  <p>
    Here it runs an update first as the image would not have the current remote repository state available.
    Then it performs the installation of the required packages.
    Finally, it removes all traces of the files written by apt.
  </p>
  <p>
    This last step is the important part here but keeping them all on the same <code>RUN</code> command ensures that
    just one layer is generated for this step.
  </p>
  <p>
    Don't try to do too much in this step as the result will be cached so subsequent builds will use the same image
    until either something changes earlier in the Dockerfile. This will save a lot of repeated downloading.
  </p>
  <p>
    See <a href="../stageorder/">Stage Ordering</a> for another example of this and why it's better to do package
    installation early on in a Dockerfile.

    <p>
      When using <code>apt</code> or <code>apt-get</code> in Dockerfiles I'd advice you always use
      <code>apt-get</code> as it can handle being run from a script.
      The <code>apt</code> command doesn't like running without a tty so will write a warning to the output stating so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also with <code>apt-get install</code> and related commands,
      always include the <code>-y</code> parameter so that it doesn't try to prompt asking if you want to continue.
      This would apply to any type script not just Dockerfile.

    <p>
        If you've mirrored an image to your local repository then you can just use that instead of the
        public reference.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, if you mirrored the <code>golang:alpine</code> image to <code>docker.example.com</code>
        then just reference it as <code>docker.example.com/library/golang:alpine</code>
    </p>
    <h2>How to use both public & mirrored images in the same Dockerfile</h2>
    <p>
        If, like myself, you have a lot of Open Sourced projects you want to have a single Dockerfile which anyone
        can run without having access to, or even knowledge of your private repository.
    </p>
    <p>The solution to this is to use build arguments.</p>
    <p>
        Here's an example from one of my Dockerfiles <em>(actually from the
        <a href="https://github.com/peter-mount/documentation/blob/master/Dockerfile" target="_blank">Dockerfile</a>
        that builds this actual site)</em>:
    </p>
    <pre>ARG prefix
FROM ${prefix}golang:alpine AS build</pre>
    <p>
        Here we have a build argument <code>prefix</code> and in the FROM line we've prefixed the source image name,
        so where we want to use <code>golang:alpine</code> we've defined it as <code>${prefix}golang:alpine</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        When someone runs the build, <code>prefix</code> defaults to "" so they get the public <code>golang:alpine</code> image.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, locally you can run docker build passing the prefix to your local repository:
    </p>
    <pre>docker build --build-arg prefix=docker.example.com/library/ -t myproject:latest .</pre>
    <p>
        As you've now set the prefix to point to your local repository then the build will now use the local
        <code>docker.example.com/library/golang:alpine</code> image instead of the public one.
    </p>

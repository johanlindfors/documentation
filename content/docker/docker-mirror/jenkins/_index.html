    <p>
        The following is an example pipeline for Jenkins to perform regular mirrors of common repositories:
    </p>
{{< highlight go "linenos=inline" >}}
node( "docker" ) {
    [
    "alpine:latest",
    "debian:11-slim",
    "debian:latest",
    "golang:alpine",
    "openjdk:11"
    ].each {
        name -> stage( name ) {
            sh "docker-mirror -d docker.example.com " + name
        }
    }
}
{{< / highlight >}}
    <p>
        This pipeline will use a jenkins node called "docker" and will run docker-mirror against each one of the
        listed images, ensuring that the version on docker.example.com is in sync.
    </p>

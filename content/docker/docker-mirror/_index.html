                    <code>docker-mirror</code> is a simple tool to mirror docker images between repositories, usually
                    from the public docker hub to a local internal repository.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You would do this if you use an image frequently.
                    For example I mirror the <code>golang:alpine</code> as I run a lot of builds using golang to compile
                    multiple projects, so it makes sense to have a local mirror of that image.
                </p>

                    This has multiple benefits:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Builds are faster as any pull's occur locally removing the internet or your, usually slower
                        than Ethernet internet connection.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Docker now have limits on how often you can pull an image over a set period of time.
                        If you have an image used across multiple machines this can quickly push you over the limit.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If your internet connection goes down, or the public repository is unavailable you can still
                        work
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
                <p>
                    Because this utility uses the
                    <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/manifest/" target="_blank">docker manifest</a>
                    command you need to enable experimental features to the Docker CLI.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You also need to be logged in to the destination repository when running the tool with an account
                    that allows you to push to that repository.
                </p>
                <h3>Isn't this the same as docker pull?</h3>
                <p>
                    In most instances you can do exactly the same thing with the following 3 docker commands:
                </p>
                <pre>docker pull golang:alpine
docker tag library/golang:alpine docker.example.com/library/golang:alpine
docker push docker.example.com/library/golang:alpine</pre>
                <p>
                    However this works only for images built for the same architecture as the machine running those
                    commands.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have a muti-architecture environment, or need to support multiple architectures like amd64 &
                    arm then this is where docker-mirror becomes useful as it will automatically mirror all
                    architectures an image supports.
                </p>
                <h3>Doesn't docker already support a local mirror?</h3>
                <p>
                    Yes it does, however it doesn't work due to a bug with docker
                    <a href="https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/30880" target="_blank">#30880</a> causes it to fail for
                    non-root users.
                </p>
                <h3>Where's the source?</h3>
                <p>
                    The source for this tool is on github at

    A Here document is a set of lines in a script which is to be sent to a command as it's input.
  </p>
  <p>
    It consists of <code>&lt;&lt;deliminator</code> followed by multiple lines and then a line with just
    <code>demiminator</code> to show the end of the document.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, we have a 4 line document that will be sent to the command as it's standard input:
  </p>

{{< highlight go "linenos=inline" >}}
command <<TERMINATOR
line 1
line 2
line $someVar
line 4
TERMINATOR
{{< / highlight >}}

    <p>
        Reading a file into a bash script on a per-line basis is pretty simple:
    </p>

{{< highlight go "linenos=inline" >}}
while read -r line; do command "${line}"; done < src.file
{{< / highlight >}}

    <p>
        here we read a line from stdin and as long as a line was read the line is passed to command as a single command
        argument.
    </p>
    <p>
        the <code>-r</code> option prevents backslash escapes in the line being interpreted.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you want to prevent leading or trailling whitespace from being removed from the line then add
        <code>IFS=</code> to the line:
    </p>

{{< highlight go "linenos=inline" >}}
while IFS= read -r line; do command "${line}"; done < src.file
{{< / highlight >}}

    <h2>Within scripts</h2>
    <p>
        The above is useful when writing something quick on the command line, but in a script it's more customary
        to write this across multiple lines.
    </p>
    <p>
        What I tend to do is wrap the while loop within <code>( )</code> with the input redirect after the parentheses.
        To me this makes it clearer on what the bounds of the script relates to the input.
    </p>

    <p>
        For example, here we have a script which writes the content of a file to stdout but adds line numbers to the output:
    </p>
    {{< book/include src="content/linux/scripting/bash/data/file-by-line/morelines.sh" >}}
    <p>
        When run against itself:
    </p>
    {{< book/include src="content/linux/scripting/bash/data/file-by-line/morelines.txt" >}}
</div>

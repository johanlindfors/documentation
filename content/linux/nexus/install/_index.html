    <div class="alert-info">
        First ensure you have docker up and running on the host you want to run this on.
    </div>
    <p>
        Here we will build a container based on the official <code>sonatype/nexus3</code> image and then configure
        systemd to ensure that it is started on startup.
    </p>
    <p>
        We build our own image as we need to modify how it logs.
        If we don't do this then nexus's logs will go to the system's own logging and not it's own.
    </p>

    <h2>Building the container</h2>
    <p>
        Create a new directory and copy the following into a <code>Dockerfile</code> file:
    </p>
{{< highlight go "linenos=inline" >}}
ARG nexusVersion
FROM sonatype/nexus3:${nexusVersion}

WORKDIR /opt/sonatype/nexus
USER root
RUN echo "-Djava.util.prefs.userRoot=/opt/sonatype/nexus" >>bin/nexus.vmoptions &&\
    sed -i 's|<appender-ref ref="console"/>||g' etc/logback/logback.xml
USER nexus
{{< / highlight >}}

    <p>
        Next run the following to build the image:
        <em>Substitute 3.36.0 with the current version</em>
    </p>
{{< highlight go "linenos=inline" >}}
docker build -t nexus:latest --build-arg nexusVersion=3.36.0
{{< / highlight >}}

    <p>
        What this does is pull the official image for the specified version,
        modify the userRoot to /opt/sonatype/nexus inside the container
        and remove the console logging appender.
        Without the latter the Nexus logs would be echoed to systemd and the host's logging.
    </p>

    <h2>Configure SystemD</h2>
    <p>
        Next we need to configure systemd, so create <code>/etc/systemd/system/nexus.service</code> with the following:
    </p>
{{< highlight go "linenos=inline" >}}
[Unit]
Description=Nexus
After=network.target, docker.service
Require=docker.service

[Service]
TimeoutStartSec=0
Restart=always
LimitNOFILE=32767
LimitNPROC=32767
Environment=IMAGE=nexus:latest
ExecStartPre=-/usr/bin/docker stop %n
ExecStartPre=-/usr/bin/docker rm %n
ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker run \
  --name %n \
  -v /usr/local/nexus:/opt/sonatype/sonatype-work \
  -e NEXUS_CONTEXT= \
  -p 8081-8083:8081-8083 \
  ${IMAGE}
ExecStop=/usr/bin/docker stop %n

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
{{< / highlight >}}

    <p>
        Here the main parts are:
    </p>
    <p>
        Line 11 is the image name you used when building the image
    </p>
    <p>
        Line 16 defines the volume. Here we are going to use <code>/usr/local/nexus</code> on the host to store the
        repositories and configuration.
        You can change this to anything you like. Usually it's under /usr/local but put it where you have
        plenty of space, or on a dedicated volume.
    </p>
    <p>
        Line 18 lists the ports we want to expose to the network.
        Normally 8081 is enough for httpd but as we also use Nexus as a docker repository we need additional ports.
    </p>

    <p>
        Make certain the directory on the host defined on Line 16 exists, then start nexus for the first time:
    </p>

{{< highlight go "linenos=inline" >}}
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/nexus
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start nexus
tail -F /usr/local/nexus/nexus3/log/nexus.log
{{< / highlight >}}

    <p>
        If all goes well you should see nexus logging in the <code>nexus3/log/nexus.log</code> file within the volume.
    </p>
    <p>
        You should then be able to connect to port 8081 on your machine, e.g. <code>http://10.11.12.13:8081/</code>
    </p>

    <div class="alert-warning">
        You must now change the default password!
        The default user is <code>admin</code> and the password <code>admin123</code>.
    </div>

    <h2>To start nexus after a reboot</h2>
    <p>
        When you are happy with the setup simply run <code>sudo systemctl enable nexus</code> then nexus will start
        automatically after a reboot.
    </p>

    <h2>Configure for HTTPS</h2>
    <p>
        What's described above is good enough for most home lab networks, however ideally you should also configure it
        for https.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm not going to describe that here but I run <a href="https://traefik.io/traefik/" target="_blank">Traefik</a>
        as a docker container with <a href="https://www.letsencrypt.org/" target="_blank">Lets Encrypt</a>, IPv6 and
        access rules to get proper HTTPS certificates working.
    </p>
    <p>
        The configuration is almost identical as above - as long as the Traefik container can see the ports of the
        Nexus container then the <code>-p</code> line in the <code>systemd/nexus.service</code> file can be removed so
        access is only via the proxy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Other alternatives to Traefik like <a href="http://www.haproxy.org/" target="_blank">HAProxy</a> or even
        <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache HTTPD</a> are available.
    </p>

        Now we have a working installation it's time to set up mirrors for package repositories.
    </p>
    <h2>Naming conventions</h2>
    <p>
        Although you can call the repositories anything you want, it's advisable to keep to a naming convention.
        The number of repositories will grow over time, and it will become obvious later which repository is for which
        package manager.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because of this I advise the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Keep repository names lower case and use <code>-</code> as a word separator. Never use a space.
        </li>
        <li>
            The first word in a repository name should be the type,<br/>
            e.g. <code>apt</code> for an apt repository,
            <code>npm</code> for a node/npm repository etc.
        </li>
        <li>
            The second word in a repository name should be the distribution.<br/>
            For example, <code>apt-debian</code> for Debian,
            <code>apt-ubuntu</code> for Ubuntu
            or <code>apt-raspbian</code> for Raspberry PI OS.
        </li>
        <li>
            Any subsequent words in the name would be for specific repository names.<br/>
            e.g. <code>apt-debian-security</code> for the Debian security repository.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Keeping to this scheme will make it easier to maintain as well as keeping like repositories next to each other
        within the Nexus UI.
    </p>

    <h2>Object Stores</h2>
    <p>
        Each repository mirror requires an object store to store the cached artefacts.
        It's advisable to create a new object store for each type of repository.
    </p>
    <p>
        So for any mirror whose name starts with <code>apt-debian</code> then create a keystore called
        <code>debian</code> and use it as the backing store for all of them.
        Do the same for Ubuntu, Raspberry PI OS etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are mirroring third party repositories like NVidia or OBS then you can either create an object store
        for each or create one called <code>thirdparty</code> and use that for those smaller repositories.
        The naming is up to you, but it can help in keeping artefacts separate & not have individual large stores.

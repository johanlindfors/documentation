    <p>
        If you have a large number of machines locally,
        or use <a href="../../docker/build/">Docker</a> builds a lot then running a local
        package repository can help in reducing both the download times for packages and reduce the bandwidth
        used both on your internet connection and at the remote repositories.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this guide I will show how to setup
        <a href="https://www.sonatype.com/products/repository-oss" target="_blank">Sonatype Nexus Repository OSS</a>
        in a docker container and use it as a target for all of your Linux boxes so that when they perform
        an update they use a local cached version of packages, leaving the retrieval & updating of the cache to Nexus.

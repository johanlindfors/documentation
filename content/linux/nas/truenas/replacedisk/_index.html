        If you want to replace a disk in a ZFS pool you normally do it from the UI, selecting a spare drive that is at
        least the same size as the one to replace, then use it as the replacement for the original drive.
        An hour or so later the new drive has been populated with the data from the old one and the original disk is
        removed from the pool so that it can be replaced.
    </p>
    <h2>The problem</h2>
    <p>
        In my instance I was upgrading a two-drive pool from two 2TB drives to two 4TB drives,
        so I had to replace each one, one at a time by installing the new drive in a spare bay, then get ZFS to replace
        the original disk with the new one.
    </p>
    <p>
        This works fine as long as the new drive is the same size or larger than the original.
    </p>
    <p>
        In TrueNAS Core 13.0-Release, that process is
        <a href="https://www.truenas.com/docs/core/corereleasenotes/#cli-disk-replacements" target="_blank">broken</a>
        and you have to use a script to perform this task.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now that script works fine and the link above does show how to do it, but one issue I had was that TrueNAS uses
        gptid's as the identifiers in the pool, so how do I map the actual gptid to remove to the disk?
    </p>
    <p>
        If this was replacing a degraded disk then that's not a problem as it would show, but in my case I was increasing
        the size so the drive's state is ONLINE so not easily identifiable.

    <h2>The solution</h2>

    <h3>List the specific pool with the disk to replace</h3>
    <p>
        Run <code>zpool status &lt;pool name&gt;</code> where <code>&lt;pool name&gt;</code> is the name of the
        Pool.
        In this example it's <code>Pool1</code>
    </p>
    {{< book/include src="content/linux/nas/truenas/replacedisk/replace1.txt" >}}

    <h3>Identify the disk to replace</h3>
    <p>
        Here we have 2 disks, ada1 which is the one to replace and is a member of the pool and ada2 which is our
        new one.
        In the TrueNAS UI we don't see gptid's so we need to identify which one of the above relates to the ada1
        disk.
    </p>
    <p>
        To do this we can use the <code>glabel status</code> command which lists the mappings:
    </p>
    {{< book/include src="content/linux/nas/truenas/replacedisk/replace2.txt" >}}
    <p>
        From this we can see that drive ada1 partition 2 (ada1p2) maps to
        gptid/746cf510-8712-11ea-b4bb-28924a2f0b10
        which is what we need.
    </p>

    <h3>Run the script to replace the disk</h3>
    <p>
        First download the tool, either with
        <code>curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/truenas/gist/main/replace_disk.py -o
            replace_disk.py</code>
        or the copy listed in the Resources' section at the top right of this page.
    </p>
    <p>
        Next run it with <code>python3 replace_disk.py &lt;pool_name&gt; &lt;gptid/####&gt; &lt;ada#&gt;</code>
        substituting the pool_name, gptid and ada parameters:
    </p>
    {{< book/include src="content/linux/nas/truenas/replacedisk/replace3.txt" >}}
    <p>
        You should then see it appear in the UI that it's now replacing the disk and the ETA on when it will
        complete.
    </p>

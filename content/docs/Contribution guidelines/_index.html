We use <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> to format and generate our website using a customised version of the
<a href="https://github.com/google/docsy">Docsy</a> theme for styling and site structure.
</p>
<p class="text-left">
A docker container is then used to run a custom tool which generates additional content from page metadata,
including svg diagrams and PDF versions of the various sections on the site.
</p>
<p class="text-left">
Although you can write content in Markdown we tend to use traditional HTML for most pages as that gives us finer
control of the content.

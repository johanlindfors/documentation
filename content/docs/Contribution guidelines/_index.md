  How to contribute to the documentation
---

We use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to format and generate our website using a customised version of the
[Docsy](https://github.com/google/docsy) theme for styling and site structure.

A docker container is then used to run a custom tool which generates additional content from page metadata,
including svg diagrams and PDF versions of the various sections on the site.

Although you can write content in Markdown we tend to use traditional HTML for most pages as that gives us finer
control of the content.

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review.
We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose.
Consult [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more information on using pull requests.

Unless otherwise specified, all content in the documentation is covered by the [CC BY-SA license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).

## Updating a single page

If you've just spotted something you'd like to change while using the docs:

1. Click **Edit this page** in the top right hand corner of the page.
2. If you don't already have an up to date fork of the project repo, you are prompted to get one - click **Fork this repository and propose changes** or **Update your Fork** to get an up to date version of the project to edit. The appropriate page in your fork is displayed in edit mode.
3. Make your changes and send a pull request (PR)

## Creating an issue

If you've found a problem in the docs, but you're not sure how to fix it yourself, please create an issue in the [Documentation repo](https://github.com/peter-mount/documentation/issues).
You can also create an issue about a specific page by clicking the **Create documentation issue** or **Create project issue** buttons in the top right hand corner of the page.

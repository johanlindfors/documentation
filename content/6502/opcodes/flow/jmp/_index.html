<p>
  The branch instructions sets the Program Counter to a new value from which the next instruction will be taken.
</p>

<div style="break-inside: avoid">
  <h2>JMP - Jump to location</h2>
  <p>
    The program counter is loaded with the target address. If a long JMP is executed the bank is loaded from the third
    byte of the address.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some assemblers accept <strong>JML</strong> as an alternate mnemonic for <strong>JMP long</strong>.
  </p>
</div>

<div style="break-inside: avoid">
  <h2>BRA - Branch Always</h2>
  <p>
    A branch is always taken, no test is performed. It is equivalent to a JMP instruction, except that as it
    uses a signed displacement it is only 2 bytes in length instead of 3 for JMP.
    In addition, because it uses displacements, code using BRA is relocatable.
  </p>
  <p>
    The 1-byte signed displacement in the second byte of the instruction is sign-extended to 16-bits
    and added to the Program Counter.
    If the branch is not taken then the instruction immediately following the 2-byte instruction is executed.
  </p>
  <p>
    The allowable range of the displacement is -128 to +127 from the instruction immediately following the branch.
  </p>
  <p>
    BRA was introduced with the 65C02 processor.
  </p>
</div>

<div style="break-inside: avoid">
  <h2>BRL - Branch Always Long</h2>
  <p>
    A branch is always taken, no test is performed. It is equivalent to a BRA instruction, except that
    BRL is a 3 byte instruction. The two bytes after the opcode form a 16-bit signed displacement
    from the Program Counter.
  </p>
  <p>
    The allowable range of the displacement is anywhere within the current 64K program bank.
  </p>
  <p>
    The advantage of BRL is that it makes code relocatable,
    although it is 1 cycle slower than the absolute JMP instruction.
  </p>
  <p>
    BRL was introduced with the 65802 processor.

<p>The flag instructions manipulate some of the flags in the status register.</p>

<div style="break-inside: avoid">
  <h3>CLC - Clear Carry Flag</h3>
  <p>
    CLC is used prior to addition with the ADC instruction to keep the carry flag affecting the result.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the 6502 a CLC before a BCC instruction can be used to implement a branch always, which is relocatable.
    This is unnecessary since the 65C02 with it's BRA instruction.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the 16-bit processors a CLC followed by XCE instruction is used to switch the 65802 & 65816 processors into
    native mode.
  </p>
</div>

<div style="break-inside: avoid">
  <h3>SEC - Set Carry Flag</h3>
  <p>
    SEC is used prior to subtraction using the SBC instruction to keep the carry flag affecting the result.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the 16-bit processors a SEC followed by XCE instruction is used to switch the 65802 & 65816 processors into 6502
    emulation mode.
  </p>
</div>

<div style="break-inside: avoid">
  <h3>CLD - Clear Decimal Mode</h3>
  <p>
    CLD is used to switch the processors into binary mode so that the ADC & SBC instructions will perform binary not BCD
    arithmetic.
  </p>
</div>

<div style="break-inside: avoid">
  <h3>SED - Set Decimal Mode</h3>
  <p>
    SED is used to switch the processors into decimal mode so that the ADC & SBC instructions will perform BCD not
    binary arithmetic.
  </p>
</div>

<div style="break-inside: avoid">
  <h3>CLI - Clear Interrupt Disable Flag</h3>
  <p>
    CLI is used to re-enable hardware interrupts.
  </p>
  <p>
    When the processor starts the interrupt handler it sets the i flag to prevent another interrupt to occur during that
    handler.
    If the handler want's to allow interrupts to happen whilst it's handling a previous one it can use CLI to re-enable
    them.
    The handler doesn't need to use CLI as the RTI (ReTurn from Interrupt) instruction will clear the i flag
    automatically.
  </p>
  <p>
    In user code, CLI can be used to re-enable interrupts after an SEI instruction.
    This is usually used during time-critical code or code that cannot be interrupted.
  </p>
</div>

<div style="break-inside: avoid">
  <h3>SEI - Clear Interrupt Disable Flag</h3>
  <p>
    SEI is used to disable hardware interrupts.
  </p>
  <p>
    When the i bit is set, maskable hardware interrupts are ignored.
    When the processor starts the interrupt handler it sets the i flag to prevent another interrupt to occur during that
    handler.
    If the handler want's to allow interrupts to happen whilst it's handling a previous one it can use CLI to re-enable
    them.
    The handler doesn't need to use CLI as the RTI (ReTurn from Interrupt) instruction will clear the i flag
    automatically.
  </p>
  <p>
    In user code, SEI can be used to disable interrupts when it needs to run time-critical code or code that cannot be
    interrupted.
    It should then use CLI once it's finished that time-critical code.
  </p>
</div>

<div style="break-inside: avoid">
  <h3>CLV - Clear Overflow Flag</h3>
  <p>
    CLV clears the overflow flag.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unlike other clear flag instructions, there is no set overflow flag available.
    The only way the overflow flag can be set is either:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The BIT instruction will set overflow if bit 6 of the mask & memory is set</li>
    <li>The 65816 REP instruction can clear the overflow</li>
    <li>Use the Overflow pin on the processor. This is rarely used & is often not even connected.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    On the 6502 a CLC before a BVC instruction can be used to implement a branch always, which is relocatable.
    This is unnecessary since the 65C02 with it's BRA instruction.
  </p>
</div>

<div style="break-inside: avoid">
  <h3>REP - Reset Status Bits</h3>
  <p>
    For each bit set in the operand byte, reset the corresponding bit in the status register.
    For each bit not set in the operand byte leaves the corresponding bit unchanged.
  </p>
  <p>
    This instruction lets you clear any flag or flags in a single instruction.
    It is the only direct means of resetting the m & x flags.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 6502 emulation mode (e=1) neither the b flag or bit 5 (the 6502's non-flag bit) is affected by this instruction.

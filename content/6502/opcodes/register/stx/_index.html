<p>
  Stores the index register X into memory.
</p>
<p>
  On all processors, the data written to memory is 8-bit.
  However, for 16-bit processors with the m flag is clear then the data written is 16-bit
  with the low-order 8-bits at the effective address and the high-order 8-bits at the effective address plus one.

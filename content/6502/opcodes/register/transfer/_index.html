<p>
    The transfer register set of instructions allows for data to be passed between different registers.
</p>
<p>
    In all of these transfer instructions, the source register is unchanged.
</p>
<p>
    For example, on the 6502 to save the X register on the stack you would need to use the following:
</p>
{{< highlight go "linenos=table" >}}
TXA      ; Transfer X into A
PHA      ; Push A to the stack
{{< / highlight >}}
<p>
    Note: On the 65C02 and later this is replaced by the PHX instruction which doesn't touch the accumulator.
</p>

<div style="break-inside: avoid">
    <h2>TAX - Transfer Accumulator to Index Register X</h2>
    <p>

        On the 8-bit processors the registers are all the same size, however on the 16-bit processors the registers can
        be
        of different sizes. The following table describes how the data is transferred when a size mismatch occurs:

        TCD transfers the 16-bit accumulator C to the direct page register D, regardless of the accumulator/memory flag.

    <p>
        The C accumulator is used to indicate that 16-bits are transferred regardless of the m flag.
        If the A accumulator is 8-bit due to m=1 or in 6502 emulation mode then C = A as the low 8-bits and the hidden B
        accumulator as the high 8-bits.

    <h2>XBA - Exchange the B & A accumulators</h2>
    <p>
        On the 16-bit processors the 16-bit C accumulator is formed of two 8-bit accumulators,
        A for the low 8-bits and B for the upper 8-bits.
        XBA swaps the contents of the A & B registers.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 8-bit memory mode, B is usually referred to as the hidden B accumulator, so the XBA instruction
        can be used to swap the accessible A with B, providing an in-processor scratch accumulator rather than pushing a
        value to the stack.
    </p>
    <p>
        The flags are based on the value of the 8-bit A accumulator

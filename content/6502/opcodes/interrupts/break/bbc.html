<p>
    In the operating system for the BBC Micro (& Acorn Electron), the standard is to write BRK followed by an error number,
    then the error message ending with a 0
</p>
{{< highlight go "linenos=inline" >}}
BRK           ; Software break
EQUB 0        ; Error code
EQUS "Silly"  ; This is a real error message in BBC BASIC, try: AUTO10,1000
EQUB 0        ; End of message marker
{{< / highlight >}}
<p>
    Service ROM's usually write error messages into RAM starting at &0100 and then do a JMP &0100 to run it.
    They do that as the handler is usually in a Language rom so they would be paged out if they ran BRK from their own ROM.

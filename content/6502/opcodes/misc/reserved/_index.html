Do not use this instruction. It will break if/when a future processor is released with additional instructions.

<p>
    The 65802 & 654816 processors use 255 out of the possible 256 8-bit opcodes.
    The remaining opcode is this one, labeled WDM which happens to be the initials of William D. Mensch who designed the processors.
</p>
<p>
    To allow additional instructions to be added later this instruction act's as a prefix allowing an additonal 256 opcodes.
    This is a similar technique to the Z80 & 8080 processors which have 2-byte extension opcodes.
</p>
<p>
    The actual number of bytes and cycles involved will be depended on those extensions, however the byte size will be
    a minimum of 2 bytes.
</p>

<p>
    On the 65802 & 65816 this instruction will execute as a 2-byte NOP.

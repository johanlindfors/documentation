<p>
    The MOS Technology 6502 (typically pronounced "sixty-five-oh-two" or "six-five-oh-two") is an 8-bit
    microprocessor that was designed by a small team led by Chuck Peddle for MOS Technology.
    The design team had formerly worked at Motorola on the Motorola 6800 project; the 6502 is essentially a simplified,
    less expensive and faster version of that design.

<p>
    The processor is still manufactured today in it's CMOS form as the 65C02.

    It was first introduced in 1975 in a 40-Pin DIP package.

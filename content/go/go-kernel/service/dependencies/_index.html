    <p>
        A service can have dependencies on other services.
        During startup, when a service declares it has a dependency then that service will be started before it's
        dependent.
        This ensures that a services' functionality is in a valid state during the lifetime of the application.
    </p>
    <p>
        Dependencies are declared in a service by either <a href="../inject/">injection</a>
        or in the <a href="../init/">Init</a> lifecycle phase.
    </p>

    <p>
        The the following example we have an application with 4 services.
        Service A depends on B & C, B on C and C with D.
        This relationship is shown with the black arrows.
    </p>
    <img src="dependency.svg" alt="Dependency tree"/>
    <p>
        The red arrows show dependencies which are invalid as they create circular dependency which is described below.
    </p>

<div class="printPageBreakAvoid">
    <h3>Circular dependencies</h3>
    <p>
        The kernel does not allow circular dependencies.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the example above we have four services called A, B, C and D.
        The black arrows show the valid dependencies but the red arrows show illegal dependencies - that is, a
        dependency that cannot be made as it would create a circular dependency.
    </p>
    <p>
        The reason this is an issue is that, when a circular dependency exists the kernel cannot determine the
        correct starting order.
    </p>
    <p>
        e.g. if C depends on A, but A indirectly depends on C via B which one should start first?
    </p>
    <p>
        If this situation happens during the injection or init lifecycle phases the kernel itself will stop returning an
        error.

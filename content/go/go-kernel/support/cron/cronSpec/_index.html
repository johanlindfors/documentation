    <p>The following describes a Cron specification. This is copied from the underlying libraries documentation.</p>
    <p>A cron expression represents a set of times, using 6 space-separated fields.</p>

    <h2>Special Characters</h2>
    <table class="table table-sm table-borderless">
        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th>*</th>
            <td>
                <p>
                    The asterisk indicates that the cron expression will match for all values of the field.
                </p>
                <p>
                    e.g., using an asterisk in the 5th field (month) would indicate every month.
                </p>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>/</th>
            <td>
                <p>
                    Slashes are used to describe increments of ranges.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example 3-59/15 in the 1st field (minutes) would indicate the 3rd minute of the hour and every
                    15 minutes thereafter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The form "*\/..." is equivalent to the form "first-last/...", that is, an increment over the largest
                    possible range of the field.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The form "N/..." is accepted as meaning "N-MAX/...", that is, starting at N, use the increment until
                    the end of that specific range.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It does not wrap around.

            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>,</th>
            <td>
                <p>
                    Commas are used to separate items of a list. For example, using "MON,WED,FRI" in the 5th field (day
                    of week) would mean Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.
                </p>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>-</th>
            <td>
                <p>
                    Hyphens are used to define ranges.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, 9-17 would indicate every hour between 9am and 5pm inclusive.
                </p>

            <td>
                <p>
                    Question mark may be used instead of '*' for leaving either day-of-month or day-of-week blank.

<div class="printPageBreakAvoid">
    <h2>Intervals</h2>
    <p>
        You may also schedule a job to execute at fixed intervals.
        This is supported by formatting the cron spec like this:
    </p>
    {{< highlight go "linenos=inline" >}}@every &lt;duration&gt;{{< / highlight >}}

    <p>
        where "duration" is a string accepted by
        <a href="http://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration">time.ParseDuration</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, "@every 1h30m10s" would indicate a schedule that activates every 1 hour, 30 minutes, 10 seconds.
    </p>
    <div class="alert-warning">
        <p>
            The interval does not take the job runtime into account.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, if a job takes 3 minutes to run, and it is scheduled to run every 5 minutes,
            it will have only 2 minutes of idle time between each run.
        </p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="printPageBreakAvoid">
    <h2>Time zones</h2>
    <p>
        By default, all interpretation and scheduling is done in the machine's local time zone.
        The time zone may be overridden by providing an additional space-separated field at the beginning of the cron
        spec, of the form "TZ=Asia/Tokyo"
    </p>
    <div class="alert-warning">
        <p>
            Be aware that jobs scheduled during daylight-savings leap-ahead transitions will not be run!

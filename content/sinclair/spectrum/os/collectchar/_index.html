    <code>RST 3</code> returns the character addressed by <code>CHADD</code> returning it if it's printable.
    If it is not printable then <code>CHADD</code> is incremented until a printable character is found.
</p>

<p>
    <code>RST 4</code> increments <code>CHADD</code> first before returning the next printable character.
</p>

<p>
    These two resets are used in multiple places in the ROM, the BASIC tokenizer being one of them.

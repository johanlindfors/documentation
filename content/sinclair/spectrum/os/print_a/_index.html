<p>
    <code>RST 2</code> is usually used to write to the current channel, usually the screen.
</p>

<p>
  Internally, <code>RST 2</code> calls the routine in the <code>CHURCHL</code> vector,
  returning with all registers preserved unless an error occurred.
</p>

<h2>Implementing custom channels</h2>
<p>
  Because the rom code uses the <code>CHURCHL</code> vector you can easily replace the
  current output channel with your own code.
</p>
<p>
  My Teletext emulator does this to allow code to write to the new screen using <code>RST 2</code>.

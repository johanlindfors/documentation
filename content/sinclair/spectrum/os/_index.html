    Unlike most manufacturers, the spectrum rom doesn't have many standard rom entry points with most of them undocumented.
    This meant that the addresses changed between the different machines.
</p>
<p>
    For example, all 48K Spectrum's had the same ROM, so you were almost guaranteed to be able to use the same routine
    on different machines.
</p>
<p>
    However, the 128K introduced 2 roms so there had to be differences.
</p>
<p>
    With the +2A/+3 came 4 roms and to complicate things there exists an English and Spanish version of these roms with
    different addresses.
</p>
<p>
    Unless otherwise specified, the entry points in this section will be for the 48K Spectrum as that has more
    documentation available.

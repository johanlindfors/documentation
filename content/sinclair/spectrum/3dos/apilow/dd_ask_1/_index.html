<h3>Synopsys</h3>
<p>
  Check to see if unit 1 is present.
  BASIC holds this information in bit 5 of the FLAGS3 system variable.
</p>
<p>
  Turn motor on.
</p>
<p>
  Fetch drive status.
</p>
<p>
  If unit 1 is not-ready and write-protected, then unit 1 is missing.
  Start motor off timeout.
</p>
<p>
  Note that this routine can be fooled by disks which are almost, but not quite, inserted in the drive.
</p>
<p>
  This routine assumes that when a disk is not in the drive, then write-protect is true.
  This is indeed the case for 3 inch and 8 inch disk drives, but is not the case for 5 1/4 inch disk drives.

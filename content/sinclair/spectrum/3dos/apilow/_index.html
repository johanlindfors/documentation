<p>
  The following are the floppy disk driver routines.
  The unit number is 0&hellip;3 for the uPD765A.
  On the +3, unit 0 is drive A: and unit 1 is drive B:, or optionally, both A: and B: may be mapped onto unit 0.
  Units 2 and 3 are not used.
</p>
<p>
  With the exception of DD_INTERFACE, none of these routines may be called if the floppy disk interface is not present.
</p>
<p>
  All routines assume that interrupts are enabled on entry, and will still be enabled on exit.

<h3>Synopsys</h3>
<p>
  Fills a buffer with part of the directory (sorted).
</p>
<p>
  The filename specifies the drive, user and a (possibly ambiguous) filename.
</p>
<p>
  Since the size of a directory is variable (and may be quite large), this routine permits the directory to be
  catalogued in a number of small sections.
  The caller passes a buffer pre-loaded with the first required filename, or zeroes for the start of the directory.
  The buffer is loaded with part (or all, if it fits) of the directory sorted in ASCII order.
  If more of the directory is required, this routine is re-called with the buffer re-initialised with the last file
  previously returned.
  This procedure is followed repeatedly until all of the directory has been catalogued.
</p>
<p>
  Note that +3DOS format disks (which are the same as single-sided, single track AMSTRAD PCW range format disks) may
  have a maximum of 64 directory entries.

<h3>Exit Parameters</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>If OK:</dt>
  <dd>Carry true</dd>
  <dd>A corrupt</dd>
  <dd>
    B number of completed entries in buffer, 0&hellip;n.<br/>
    If B=n then there may be more entries for subsequent calls
  </dd>
  <dt>Otherwise:</dt>
  <dd>Carry false</dd>
  <dd>A=Error code</dd>
  <dd>B corrupt</dd>
  <dt>Always:</dt>
  <dd>C DE HL IX corrupt, all other registers preserved.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Buffer format</h3>
<p>
  The buffer passed to this routine consists of 2 or more entries, with the first one initialised
  with the first filename required.
  It is valid for the first entry to be all zero's.
</p>
<p>
  If the buffer is too small for the directory then it can be called again with entry 0 being a
  copy of entry n from the previous call.

<h3>Synopsys</h3>
<p>
  Point at the header data for this file.
</p>
<p>
  The header data area is 8 bytes long and may be used by the caller for any purpose whatsoever.
  It is available even if the file does not have a header;
  however, only files with a header and opened with write access will have the header data recorded on disk.
</p>
<p>
  Note that +3 BASIC uses these 8 bytes (see the note under DOS OPEN which gives the details).
  If creating a file that will subsequently be LOADed within BASIC, then those bytes should be filled with the relevant values.
</p>

<div class="alert-info">
  The original manual doesn't mention exactly what IX points to after this call.
  <p>
    The address in IX is the <a href="../../fileheader/">+3 BASIC Header</a> structure which is 8 bytes long.
    (IX+0) is the file type, (IX+1) the file length and (IX+3) param 1.

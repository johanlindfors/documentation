<p>
  The display file contains the pixel data for the screen.
</p>
<p>
  Arranged in a map of 192 rows, each 32 bytes long. Each byte contains 8 pixels.
</p>
<p>
  Be aware, the rows are not stored linearly, but in a way that has been optimised for the ULA.
  So the first 256 bytes represents the first byte of each character in the first 8 rows, then the second byte
  and so on.

<p>
  This weird at first layout will be described in full further down.
</p>
<p>
  Sinclair always took the cheap route whenever possible so the memory layout is a bit odd at first.

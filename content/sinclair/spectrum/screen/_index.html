<h2>Screen Layout</h2>
<p>
  The screen has a fixed resolution of 256x192 pixels or 32x24 characters.
  Colour is restricted to 8x8 pixel squares equivalent to each character.
</p>
<p>
  It is located in memory at address 0x4000&hellip;0x5AFF and is split into two parts:
</p>
<div>
  <table class="memoryMap2">
    <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Address</th>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th colspan="8">Content</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>4000</td>
      <td class="br">DISPLAYFILE</td>
      <td class="blue brb" colspan="8" rowspan="2">Screen Memory</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="bb">57FF</td>
      <td class="brb"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>5800</td>
      <td class="br">DISPLAYATTR</td>
      <td class="green brb" colspan="8" rowspan="2">Screen Colour data</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td class="bb">5AFF</td>
      <td class="brb"></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

<h3>128K Spectrum's</h3>
<p>
  The 128K Spectrum's have a second screen in RAM Bank #7 which can be used as an alternate to the default one
  which is in RAM Bank #5. The memory layout is the same except for where it appears in the
  memory map.
</p>
<p>
  This section will refer to the default memory location as used by all Spectrum's.
</p>
<p>
  If you want to use the alternate screen then you need to change the base address to that of the correct bank.
  These are shown in the memory map's:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="../memorymap/128k/">Spectrum 128K and +2</a> also for +2A and +3 in Normal Mode</li>
  <li><a href="../memorymap/plus3/">Spectrum +2A and +3</a> when in Special Mode</li>
</ul>

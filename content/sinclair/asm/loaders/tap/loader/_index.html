<p>
  This shows the source for the BASIC .TAP loader for use with the <code>zasm</code> assembler.
</p>

<p>
  To compile run the following commands in a Linux shell to download the sources and compile the loader:
</p>

{{< highlight go "linenos=inline" >}}
wget https://area51.dev/sinclair/spectrum/reference/include/zasm/headers.z80
wget https://area51.dev/sinclair/asm/loaders/tap/loader.z80
zasm loader.z80
{{< /highlight >}}
<p>
    The commands do the following:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Download <a href="../../../../spectrum/reference/include/zasm/headers/">headers.z80</a> which contains the
        definitions for the Spectrum BASIC tokens we require.
    </li>
    <li>
        Download <code>loader.z80</code> which is the source shown below.
    </li>
    <li>
        Compiles our loader generating <code>loader.tap</code>.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    The generated <code>loader.tap</code> can now be used with your own <code>.TAP</code> file as long as it loads at
    address 24000 and its entry point is also at that same address.
</p>
<p>
    All you need to do is concatenate both <code>.TAP</code> files with <code>loader.tap</code> first.
    The <a href="../#helloworld">Hello World example</a> shows how this is done.
</p>
<p>
    Links to the required files are shown in the resources panel at the top right of this page.

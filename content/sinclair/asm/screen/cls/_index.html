<p>
  This code snippet will clear the standard screen on all versions of the Spectrum.
</p>

<p>
  It's broken down into three sections:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Clear's the pixel data</li>
  <li>Reset the screen's colour data, in this instance to White text on Black Background</li>
  <li>Sets the screen border to black</li>
</ol>

<h4>Important note here:</h4>
<p>
  We copy 6144 bytes in the first <code>LDIR</code> not 6143 which we would normally do if we want to erase just the
  <code>DISPLAYFILE</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Using 6144 bytes will cause the first byte of <code>DISPLAYATTR</code> to be set to 0 which is fine here as we want
  <code>HL</code> and <code>DE</code> to be pointing to <code>DISPLAYATTR</code> ready for the second
  <code>LDIR</code> operation.
</p>
<p>
  This could, in theory cause the top left character to flicker briefly as it's been set to 0
  (BLACK foreground and background).
  If that's an issue then set the <code>BC</code> to 6143 and increment <code>HL</code> and <code>DE</code> after the
  <code>LDIR</code> as in the next example:
</p>

<p>
  There are faster but longer methods of clearing the screen which I won't go into here.
  For most purposes the first example above will work for most purposes other than time critical games.

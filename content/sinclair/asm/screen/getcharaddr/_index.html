<p>
  Calculating the start address for a character might sound complicated due to its weird memory layout, but it is
  actually pretty simple.
</p>
<p>
  The way the address is calculated is described with the <a href="../../../spectrum/screen/file/">Display File</a>,
  however the following code allows you to calculate the address in Z80 machine code.

<p>A link to download this routine is available under Resources at the top right of the page:</p>

  Note: This code is actually from my Teletext Mode 7 emulator for the Spectrum

<p>
  There is no official method of determining which model of Spectrum code is running on, however one method is to
  look for differences in the ROM on the machine.
</p>

<p>
  There were six official models of Spectrum released:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>48K with a single rom (16K had the same ROM)</li>
  <li>128K with 2 roms</li>
  <li>Spanish 128K released 1985</li>
  <li>+2 with a built-in Cassette Deck</li>
  <li>
    +2A and +3 - These have the same roms just differ with the +3 having a built-in 3" floppy drive
    instead of the cassette deck.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Below is a routine which will return a value representing the machine type the code is running on in the Accumulator.
</p>

<p>
  It works by first paging out the 48K rom - something that will do nothing on a real 48K machine,
  before checking for the Copyright string present in the 48K rom.
</p>

<p>
  If that is not present it then attempts to page out the rom on a +2A/+3 machine - as they have 4 ROM's,
  then checking for strings present on the +2A/+3, then the +2 and finally the Spanish 128K machine.
</p>

<p>
  If it got this far without a match then it's running on an original UK 128K machine.
</p>

<h3>Rom selection</h3>
<p>
  There's two additional routines in here, <code>romSel1</code> and <code>romSel2</code>,
  which handle the ROM selection and could be reused.
  They both take the new value of the port which manages the rom selection in the Accumulator and updates both the
  appropriate port and system variable.
</p>
<p>
  For romSel1 load the Accumulator from 0x5BFC and make your changes before calling this routine.
</p>
<p>
  For romSel2 load the Accumulator from 0x5B67 and make your changes before calling this routine.

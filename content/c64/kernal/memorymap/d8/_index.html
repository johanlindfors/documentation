      <h2>Memory format</h2>
      <p>
        For each character in every row (40 chars per row; 0-39) and column (25 columns; 0-24) one of 16 colors can be
        assigned.
        The color values 0-15 are only used in the lower nibbles.
        The upper nibbles are undefined and are purely random values.
      </p>
      <p>
        The colour memory is provided by an MM2114N-3 4Kb (1024x4) static RAM chip.
      </p>
      <p>
        As this chip only provides 4 bits, the upper nibble is random as it's not connected to anything.
        It is separate from the onboard 64K RAM

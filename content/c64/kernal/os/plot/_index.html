<p>
  This routine either reads or sets the text cursor's location.
</p>

<h2>Reading cursor location</h2>
<p>
  A call to this routine with the accumulator carry flag set loads the current position of the cursor on the screen (in X,Y coordinates) into the Y and X registers.
  Y is the column number of the cursor location (0-39),
  and X is the row number of the location of the cursor (0-24).
</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
        SEC           ; Set Carry flag to read the text position
        JSR PLOT
        STX curRow    ; X is the row
        STY curCol    ; Y is the column
</pre>

<h2>Setting cursor location</h2>
<p>
  A call with the carry bit clear moves the cursor to X,Y as determined by the Y and X registers.
</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
        LDX #10       ; Set cursor to row 10 column 5
        LDY #5
        CLC           ; Clear Carry flag to set the position
        JSR PLOT
</pre>

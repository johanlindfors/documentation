    <p>
        This routine sets the timeout flag for the IEEE bus.
        When the timeout flag is set, the Commodore 64 will wait for a device on the IEEE port for 64 milliseconds.
        If the device does not respond to the Commodore 64's Data Address Valid (DAV) signal within that time the Commodore 64 will recognize an error condition and leave the handshake sequence.
        When this routine is called when the accumulator contains a 0 in bit 7, timeouts are enabled.
        A 1 in bit 7 will disable the timeouts.

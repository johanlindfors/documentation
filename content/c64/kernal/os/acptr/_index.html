    <p>
        This routine gets a byte of data off the serial bus using full handshaking.
        The data is returned in the accumulator.
    </p>
    <p>
        To prepare for this routine the <a href="../talk/">TALK</a> routine must be called first to command the device on the serial bus to send data through the bus.
        If the input device needs a secondary command, it must be sent by using the <a href="../tksa/">TKSA</a> routine before calling this routine.
    </p>
    <p>
        Errors are returned in the status word.
        The <a href="../readst/">READST</a> routine is used to read the status word.

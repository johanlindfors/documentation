<div class="printPageBreakAvoid">
    <p>
        This routine scans the Commodore 64 keyboard and checks for pressed keys.
        It is the same routine called by the interrupt handler.
        If a key is down, its ASCII value is placed in the keyboard queue.
        This routine is called only if the normal IRQ interrupt is bypassed.

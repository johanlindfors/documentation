    <p>
        This routine commands all devices on the serial bus to stop receiving data.
        Calling this routine results in an UNLISTEN command being transmitted on the serial bus.
        Only devices previously commanded to listen are affected.
        This routine is normally used after the Commodore 64 has finished sending data to external devices.
        Sending the UNLISTEN commands the listening devices to get off the serial bus, so it can be used for other purposes.

<div class="printPageBreakAvoid">
  <p>
    This routine updates the system clock.
    Normally this routine is called by the normal KERNAL interrupt routine every 1/60th of a second.
    If the user program processes its own interrupts this routine must be called to update the time.
    In addition, the &lt;STOP&gt; key routine must be called, if the &lt;STOP&gt; key is to remain functional.

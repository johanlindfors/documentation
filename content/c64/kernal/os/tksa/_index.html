    <p>
        This routine transmits a secondary address on the serial bus for a TALK device.
        This routine must be called with a number between 0 and 31 in the accumulator.
        The routine sends this number as a secondary address command over the serial bus.
        This routine can only be called after a call to the <a href="../talk/">TALK</a> routine.
        It will not work after a <a href="../listen/">LISTEN</a>.

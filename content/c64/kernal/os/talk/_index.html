    <p>
        To use this routine the accumulator must first be loaded with a device number between 0 and 31.
    </p>
    <p>
        When called, this routine then ORs bit by bit to convert this device number to a talk address.
        Then this data is transmitted as a command on the serial bus.
    </p>
    <p>
        If a secondary address is required then the <a href="../tksa/">TKSA</a> routine must be called immediately after this one.

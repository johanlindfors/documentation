    <p>
        This routine will command a device on the serial bus to receive data.
        The accumulator must first be loaded with a device number between 0 and 31.
        When called, this routine then ORs bit by bit to convert this device number to a talk address.
        The specified device will then go into listen mode, and be ready to accept information.

<p>
    This routine LOADs data bytes from any input device directly into the memory.
    It can also be used for a verify operation, comparing data from a device with the data already in memory, while leaving the data stored in RAM unchanged.
</p>

<p>
    To use, you first need to call <a href="../setlfs/">SETLFS</a> to set the device to save to.
    Then <a href="../setnam/">SETNAM</a> must be called to set the filename.
</p>

<p>
    The accumulator must be set to 0 for a load or 1 for a verify operation.
</p>
<p>
    If the input device is opened with a secondary address of 0, the header information from the device is ignored.
    In this case the X &amp; Y registers must contain the starting address for the load.
</p>
<p>
    With a secondary address of 1 the data is loaded into memory starting at the location specified by the header.
</p>
<p>
    This routine returns the highest address of the data loaded on exit.
</p>

    You cannot load from devices 0 (keyboard), 2 (RS-232) or 3 (Screen).

<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
        LDA #8                      ; Logical File Number
        LDX #8                      ; Device 8 = Disk
        LDY #1                      ; Secondary address 1 = Use address stored in the file
        JSR <a href="../setlfs/">SETLFS</a>

        LDA #fileNameEnd-fileName   ; Length of fileName
        LDX #&lt;fileName              ; Address of fileName
        LDY #&gt;fileName
        JSR <a href="../setnam/">SETNAM</a>

        LDA #0                      ; Load operation
        JSR LOAD                    ; Load file

        STX endAddress              ; Optional, save address after the loaded data
        STY endAddress+1
        RTS

.fileName                           ; Filename to load
        EQUS "TESTCARD"
.fileNameEnd

    <p>
        This routine is used to send information to devices on the serial bus.
        A call to this routine will put a data byte onto the serial bus using full serial handshaking.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before this routine is called, the <a href="../listen/">LISTEN</a> routine must be used to command a device on the serial bus to get ready to receive data.
        If a device needs a secondary address, it must also be sent by using the <a href="../second/">SECOND</a> routine.
    </p>
    <p>
        The accumulator is loaded with a byte to handshake as data on the serial bus.
        A device must be listening or the status word will return a timeout.
    </p>
    <p>
        This routine always buffers one character. (The routine holds the previous character to be sent back.)
        So when a call to the <a href="../unlsn/">UNLSN</a> routine is made to end the data transmission, the buffered character is sent with an End Or Identify (EOI) set.
        Then the <a href="../unlsn/">UNLSN</a> command is sent to the device.

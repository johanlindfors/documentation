    <p>
        If the input channel is the keyboard, this subroutine removes one character from the keyboard queue and returns
        it
        as an ASCII value in the accumulator.
        If the queue is empty, the value returned in the accumulator will be zero.
    </p>
    <p>
        Characters are put into the queue automatically by an interrupt driven keyboard scan routine which calls the
        <a href="../scnkey/">SCNKEY</a> routine.
        The keyboard buffer can hold up to ten characters.
        After the buffer is filled, additional characters are ignored until at least one character has been removed from
        the
        queue.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the channel is RS-232, then only the A register is used and a single character is returned.
        See <a href="../readst/">READST</a> to check validity.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the channel is serial, cassette, or screen, call <a href="../basin/">BASIN</a> routine.

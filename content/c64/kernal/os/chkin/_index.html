    <p>
        Any logical file number that has been created by the <a href="../open/">OPEN</a> routine can be defined as an input channel.
        Of course, the device you intend opening a channel to must be an input device.
        Otherwise, an error will occur, and the routine will be aborted.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are getting data from anywhere other than the keyboard, this routine must be called before using either the <a href="../chrin/">CHRIN</a> or the <a href="../getin/">GETIN</a> routines for data input.
        If you want to use the input from the keyboard, and no other input channels are opened, then the calls to this routine, and to the <a href="../open/">OPEN</a> routine are not needed.
    </p>

    <p>Example:</p>
    <pre>
        LDX #2          ; Define logical file 2 as an input channel
        JSR CHKIN
    </pre>

<p>
    This routine saves a section of memory to a device.
</p>

<p>
    To use, you first need to call <a href="../setlfs/">SETLFS</a> to set the device to save to.
    Then <a href="../setnam/">SETNAM</a> must be called to set the filename.
</p>
<p>
    Finally you store the start address in 2 bytes of zero page memory,
    set X & Y to point to the address immediately after the data to save,
    and A to the offset within zeropage where the start address was stored.
</p>
<p>
    Any errors are reported via the <a href="../setnam/">READST</a> routine.
</p>

<div class="alert-warning">
    You cannot save to devices 0 (keyboard), 2 (RS-232) or 3 (Screen).
</div>

<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
        LDA #1                  ; Select device 1 = Cassette
        JSR <a href="../setlfs/">SETLFS</a>

        LDA #0                  ; Set no file name, valid for cassette only
        JSR <a href="../setnam/">SETNAM</a>

        LDA #&lt;startAddress      ; Start address low byte
        STA FREKZP              ; Store in zero page
        LDA #&gt;startAddress      ; Start address high byte
        STA FREKZP+1
        LDX #&lt;endAddress        ; End address of save, low byte
        LDY #&gt;endAddress        ; End address of save, high byte
        LDA #&gt;FREKZP            ; Zero page offset to FREKZP
        JSR SAVE
</pre>
<p>
    Note: FREKZP (0x00FB) in this example is a 4 byte block of zeropage memory unused by Basic or Kernal and is
    available for user code.

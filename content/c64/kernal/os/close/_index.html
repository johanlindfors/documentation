        This routine is used to close a logical file after all I/O operations have been completed on that file.
        This routine is called after the accumulator is loaded with the logical file number to be closed - the same number used when the file was opened using the <a href="../open/">OPEN</a> routine.
    </p>

    <p>Example:</p>
    <pre>
            LDA #15         ; Close logical file 15
            JSR CLOSE
    </pre>
</div>

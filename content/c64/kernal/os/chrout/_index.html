<p>
    This routine outputs a character to an already opened channel.
    Use the <a href="../open/">OPEN</a> and <a href="../chkout">CHKOUT</a> routines to set up the output channel before calling this routine.
    If this call is omitted, data is sent to the default output device (number 3, the screen).
</p>
<p>
    The data byte to be output is loaded into the accumulator, and this routine is called.
    The data is then sent to the specified output device.
    The channel is left open after the call.
</p>

<div class="alert-warning">
    <p>
        Care must be taken when using this routine to send data to a specific serial device since data will be sent to
        all open output channels on the bus.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unless this is desired, all open output channels on the serial bus other than the intended destination channel
        must be closed by a call to the <a href="../clichn">CLRCHN</a> routine.
    </p>
</div>

<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
        LDX #4              ; Logical file #4
        JSR <a href="../chkout/">CHKOUT</a>          ; Open channel 4 for output
        LDA #'A'
        JSR CHROUT          ; Send character
</pre>

<p>
    This routine is used to read the system clock.
    The clock's resolution is a 60th of a second.
    Three bytes are returned by the routine.
    The accumulator contains the most significant byte,
    the X index register contains the next most significant byte,
    and the Y index register contains the least significant byte.

<p>Example</p>
<pre>
        JSR RDTIM       ; Read system clock
        STY time        ; Store in our time variable
        STX time+1
        STA time+2
        RTS
time:   EQUB 0,0,0      ; 3 bytes to store the time

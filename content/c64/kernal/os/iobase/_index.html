<p>
  This routine sets the X and Y registers to the address of the memory section where the memory mapped 110 devices are located.
  This address can then be used with an offset to access the memory mapped I/O devices in the Commodore 64.
  The offset is the number of locations from the beginning of the page on which the I/O register you want is located.
  The X register contains the low order address byte, while the Y register contains the high order address byte.
</p>
<p>
  This routine exists to provide compatibility between the Commodore 64, VIC-20, and potential future models of the Commodore 64.
  If the I/O locations for a machine language program are set by a call to this routine, they should still remain compatible with future versions of the Commodore 64, the KERNAL and BASIC.

<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
        JSR IOBASE      ; Set the Data Direction Register (DDR) of user port
        STX point       ; Store base address
        STY point+1
        LDA #0          ; New value of User Port DDR
        LDY #2          ; Offset to DDR of user port
        STA (point),Y   ; Set the register
</pre>

        This routine sets the X and Y registers to the address of the memory section where the memory mapped 110 devices
        are located.
        This address can then be used with an offset to access the memory mapped I/O devices in the Commodore 64.
        The offset is the number of locations from the beginning of the page on which the I/O register you want is
        located.
        The X register contains the low order address byte, while the Y register contains the high order address byte.

        This routine exists to provide compatibility between the Commodore 64, VIC-20, and potential future models of
        the Commodore 64.
        If the I/O locations for a machine language program are set by a call to this routine, they should still remain
        compatible with future versions of the Commodore 64, the KERNAL and BASIC.

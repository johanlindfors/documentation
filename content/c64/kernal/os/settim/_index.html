<p>
    A system clock is maintained by an interrupt routine that updates the clock every 1/60th of a second (one "jiffy").
    The clock is three bytes long, which gives it the capability to count up to 5,184,000 jiffies (24 hours).
    At that point the clock resets to zero.
</p>
<p>
    Before calling this routine to set the clock,
    the accumulator must contain the most significant byte,
    the X index register the next most significant byte,
    and the Y index register the least significant byte of the initial time setting (in jiffies).

<p>Example</p>
<pre>
                        ; Set clock to 10 minutes = 600 seconds = 3600 jiffies
        LDA #0          ; Most significant byte
        LDX #>3600
        LDY #<3600      ; Least significant byte
        JSR SETTIM

    <p>
        A system clock is maintained by an interrupt routine that updates the clock every 1/60th of a second (one
        "jiffy").
        The clock is three bytes long, which gives it the capability to count up to 5,184,000 jiffies (24 hours).
        At that point the clock resets to zero.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before calling this routine to set the clock,
        the accumulator must contain the most significant byte,
        the X index register the next most significant byte,
        and the Y index register the least significant byte of the initial time setting (in jiffies).

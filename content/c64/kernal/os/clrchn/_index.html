<div class="printPageBreakAvoid">
    <p>
        This routine is called to clear all open channels and restore the I/O channels to their original default values.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is usually called after opening other I/O channels like a tape or disk drive and using them for input/output operations.
        The default input device is 0 (keyboard).
        The default output device is 3 (screen).
    </p>
    <p>
        This routine is automatically called when the <a href="../clall/">CLALL</a> routine is executed.

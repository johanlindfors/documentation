<p>
  The 1541 disk drive used 5.25" disks.
  The standard CBM DOS format is 170 KB with 35 tracks and 256-byte sectors providing 165K for storage.
</p>

<p>
  Although standard disks are only 35 tracks, it was mechanically possible to get 40 tracks by using either custom
  formatting or third party DOS's.
</p>

<p>
  The format described in this section also applies to <code>.D64</code> disk images that can be used with both
  Emulators like <a href="https://vice-emu.sourceforge.io/" target="_blank">VICE</a>
  and the <a href="https://github.com/pi1541/Pi1541" target="_blank">PI1541</a> attached to a real C64.

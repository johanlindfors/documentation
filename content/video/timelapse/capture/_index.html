<h2>Capture images from Webcam</h2>
<p>
    Here we have a WebCam (Insta360 One-R with 4K camera mod) presenting itself as /dev/video1 on a Raspberry PI
</p>

<p>
    To capture images every 10 seconds we can use:
</p>
{{< highlight go "linenos=inline" >}}
ffmpeg -f v4l2 -i /dev/video1 -r 1/10 out%08d.jpg
{{< /highlight >}}
<p>
    Here <code>-i /dev/video1</code> is the camera's device,
    <code>-r 1/10</code> is the capturing framerate, 1 in every 10 seconds
    and <code>out%08d.jpeg</code> is the filename for each frame generated.
</p>
<table class="memoryMap">
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Parameter</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>-f v4l2</td>
        <td>Tell ffmpeg we are reading from v4l2 (Video For Linux 2)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>-i /dev/video1</td>
        <td>The V4L2 device of the camera to capture from</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>-r 1/10</td>
        <td>The frame rate</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>out%08d.jpg</td>
        <td>The frame filename to write.</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p>
    Here the frame rate is the capture rate in frames per second.
    So 1/10 means that we capture a single frame once every 10 seconds.
</p>
<p>
    For the frame filename pattern, %08d will be replaced by the frame number, in this case 8 digits with leading 0's.

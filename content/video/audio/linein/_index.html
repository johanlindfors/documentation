<h2>Line In Passthrough</h2>
<p>
    Normally when you connect a device to the line-in socket you cannot hear the audio being received in the speakers.
</p>
<p>
    For example, I sometimes plug in a traditional audio source like a record player into line-in, so I need to do this
    to hear what's playing.
</p>
<p>
    For Ubuntu 20.04, one way to get the line-in audio being played on the speakers as received is to load the
    <code>module-loopback</code> module with the following command:
</p>

{{< highlight go "linenos=inline" >}}
pactl load-module module-loopback
{{< /highlight >}}

<p>
    Audio from line-in should appear instantly.

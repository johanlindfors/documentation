<h3>Resizing a video</h3>
<p>
    A common task is to resize a video captured on a Mobile Phone to a smaller format that's acceptable to social media
    like Mastodon. Most services have a file size limit like 50Mb so if your mobile has faithfully captured video at
    4K then that won't upload.

    So a quick option is to resize the video's physical size. The following will resize it to 480p which works
    most of the time.

{{< highlight go "linenos=inline" >}}
ffmpeg -i source.mp4 -s 720x480 smaller.mp4
{{< /highlight >}}

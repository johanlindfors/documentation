<h3>16/8 bit operation</h3>
<p>
    The MC68302 can operate either in the full MC68000 mode with a 16-bit data bus or in the
    MC68008 mode with an 8-bit data bus by tying the bus width (BUSW) pin low.
</p>
<p>
    <span class="not">UDS</span>/A<sub>0</sub> functions as A<sub>0</sub> and
    <span class="not">LDS</span>/<span class="not">DS</span> functions as <span class="not">DS</span> in the MC68008
    mode.
</p>
<div class="alert-warning">
    <p>
        The BUSW pin is static and is not intended to be used for dynamic bus sizing.
        If the state of BUSW is changed during operation of the MC68302, erratic operation may occur.
    </p>

<h2>Pin Layouts</h2>
<div class="alert-info">
    <p>
        There are PQFT and TQFP versions of this chip but the pin numbers do not match up with the datasheet
        so they have been left out until another source is found.

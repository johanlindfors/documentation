      <p>
        The 88LS120 is a dual differential, TTL compatible, line receiver for both balanced and unbalanced data transmission.
        The device features hysteresis and a response control for applications where controlled rise and falltimes and/or high frequency noise rejection are desirable.
        Threshold offset control is provided for fail-safe protection, should the input be open or short circuited.
        Each receiver includes an optional 180&#8486; terminating resistor and the output gate contains a logic strobe for time discrimination.

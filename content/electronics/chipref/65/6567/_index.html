            <h3>CHARACTER DISPLAY MODE</h3>
            <p>
                In the character display mode, the 6567 fetches CHARACTER POINTERS
                from the VIDEO MATRIX area of memory and translates the pointers to
                character dot addresses in the 2,048 byte CHARACTER BASE area of
                memory. The video matrix is comprised of 1,000 consecutive
                locations in memory which each contain an eight bit character
                pointer. The location of the video matrix within memory is defined
                by bits VM13-VM10 in register 24 (0x18) which are used as the 4 MSB
                of the video matrix address. The lower order 10 bits are provided
                by an internal couiter (VC9-VC0) which steps through the 1000
                character locations. Note that the 6567 provides only 14 address
                outputs so additional system hardware may be required for complete
                system memory decodes.

            <p>
            The eight bit character pointer permits 256 different .character
            definitions to be available simultaneously. Each character is an
            8x8 matrix of dots stored in the character base as eight consecutive
            bytes. The location of the character base is defined by bits
            CB13-CB11 in register 24 (0x18) which are used for the 3 most
            significant bits (MSB) of the character base address. The 11 lower
            order addresses are formed by the 8 bit character pointer from the
            video matrix (D7-D0) which selects a particluar character, and a 3
            bit raster counter (RC2-RC0) which selects one of the eight
            character bytes. The resulting characters are formated as 25 rows
            of 40 characters each. In addition to the 8 bit character pointer,
            a 4-bit COLOR NYBBLE is associated with each video matrix location
            (the video matrix memory is 12 bits wide) which selects one of
            sixteen colors for each character.

                The extended color mode allows the selection of individual
                background colors for each character region while maintaining the
                normal 8 x 8 character resolution. This mode is selected by
                setting the-BCM bit of register 17 (0x11) to "1M. The character
                dot data is displayed similar to the standard mode except the 2
                MSB of the character pointer are used to select the background
                color for each character region.

                is accessed as in character mode, but the video matrix data is
                interpreted as color data rather than as character pointers. The
                VIDEO MATRIX COUNTER is also used to create the address to fetch the
                dot data for display from the 3,000 byte DISPLAY BASE. The display

                (LSN). Similarly, a display memory bit of "1" selects the output

                MIB data bits of "0" always permit any other information to be
                displayed (i.e. MIB transparent sections). The MIBs have a fixed
                priority with respect to each other, with MIB 0 having the highest
                priority (in front) and MIB 7 the lowest (behind). When MIB data
                (except transparent data) of two MIBs are co-incident, the data
                from the lower number MIB will be displayed.

            <h3>COLLISION DETECTION</h3>
            <p>
                Two types of MIB collision (co-incidence) are detected, MIB to MIB
                collision and MIB to display data collision.
            </p>

            <h4>MIB TO MIB COLLISION</h4>
            <p>
                A collision between two MIBs occurs when non-transparent output
                data of two MIBs are co-incident. Co-incidence of MIB
                transparent areas will not generate a collision. When a
                collision occurs, the MIB bits (ttiM) in the MIB-MIB COLLISION
                register 30 (0x1E) will be set to "1" for each colliding MIB.
                The collision bits ranain set until a read of the collision
                register, when they are automatically cleared. MIBs collisions
                are detected even if off screen, behind the border.
            </p>

            <h4>MIB TO DATA COLLISION</h4>
            <p>
                A second register, MIB-DATA COLLISION register 31 (0x1F) also
                contains a bit (MiD) for each MIB which is set to "1" when both
                the MIB and display data are co-incident. Again, the
                co-incidence of MIB transparent data and/or display background
                does not generate a collision. For special applications, the
                display data from the 0-1 multicolor bit pair also does not
                cause a collision. This feature permits their use as background
                display data without interfering with true MIB collisions. A
                MIB-DATA collision can occur off-screen in the horizontal
                direction if display data has been scrolled to an off-screen
                position (see scrolling). The MIB-DATA COLLISION register also
                automatically clears when read
            </p>

            <h3>MIB COLLISION INTERRUPTS</h3>
            <p>
                The collision interrupt latches are set whenever the first bit
                of either register is set to "1". Once any collision bit within
                a register is set high, subsequent collisions will not set the
                interrupt latch until that collision register has been cleared
                to all "0"s by a read.

            <h3>MIB MEMORY ACCESS</h3>
            <p>
                The data for each MIB is stored in 63 consecutive bytes of memory.
                Each block of MIB data is defined by a MIB pointer, located at the
                end of the VIDEO MATRIX. Since only 1,000 bytes of the video
                matrix are used in the normal display modes video matrix locations
                1016-1023 (0x3F8-0x3FF) are used for MIB pointers 0-7 respectively.
                The eight bit MIB pointer from the video matrix together with the
                six bits from the MIB byte counter to count through the 63 bytes
                define the entire 14-bit address field.

            <h3>DYNAMIC RAM REFRESH</h3>
            <p>
                A dynamic ram refresh controller is built in to the 6567 device.
                Five 8-bit row addresses are refreshed every raster line. This
                rate guarantees a maximum delay of 2.02 ms between the refresh of
                any single row address in a 128 refresh scheme. (The maximum
                delay is 3.66ms in a 256 address refresh scheme). This refresh is
                totally transparent to the system, since the refresh occurs during
                Phase 1 of the system clock. The 6567 generates both SAS/ and
                CAS/ which are normally connected directly to the dynamic rams.
                RAS/ and CAS/ are generated for every Phase 2 and every video data
                access (including refresh) so that external clock generation is
                not required.

            <h3>CHARACTER DISPLAY MODE</h3>
            <p>
                In the character display mode, the 6567 fetches CHARACTER POINTERS
                from the VIDEO MATRIX area of memory and translates the pointers to
                character dot addresses in the 2,048 byte CHARACTER BASE area of
                memory. The video matrix is comprised of 1,000 consecutive
                locations in memory which each contain an eight bit character
                pointer. The location of the video matrix within memory is defined
                by bits VM13-VM10 in register 24 ($18) which are used as the 4 MSB
                of the video matrix address. The lower order 10 bits are provided
                by an internal couiter (VC9-VC0) which steps through the 1000
                character locations. Note that the 6567 provides only 14 address
                outputs so additional system hardware may be required for complete
                system memory decodes.

            <p>
            The eight bit character pointer permits 256 different .character
            definitions to be available simultaneously. Each character is an
            8x8 matrix of dots stored in the character base as eight consecutive
            bytes. The location of the character base is defined by bits
            CB13-CB11 in register 24 ($18) which are used for the 3 most
            significant bits (MSB) of the character base address. The 11 lower
            order addresses are formed by the 8 bit character pointer from the
            video matrix (D7-D0) which selects a particluar character, and a 3
            bit raster counter (RC2-RC0) which selects one of the eight
            character bytes. The resulting characters are formated as 25 rows
            of 40 characters each. In addition to the 8 bit character pointer,
            a 4-bit COLOR NYBBLE is associated with each video matrix location
            (the video matrix memory is 12 bits wide) which selects one of
            sixteen colors for each character.

                The extended color mode allows the selection of individual
                background colors for each character region while maintaining the
                normal 8 x 8 character resolution. This mode is selected by
                setting the-BCM bit of register 17 ($11) to "1M. The character
                dot data is displayed similar to the standard mode except the 2

                available. The 8562 forces CB10 and QB9 to "0" regardless of the
                original pointer values, so that only the first 64 character
                definitions are accessed. In extended color mode, each character
                can select one of sixteen individually defined foreground colors

                In bit map mode, the 6567 fetches data from memory to create a
                one-to-one correspondence between each displayed dot and memory bit.
                The bit map mode- provides a screen resolution of 320H x ' 200V
                individually controllable display dots. Bit map mode is selected by
                setting the BMM bit in register 17 ($11) to a ”1". The VIDEO MATRIX
                is accessed as in character mode, but the video matrix data is
                interpreted as color data rather than as character pointers. The
                VIDEO MATRIX COUNTER is also used to create the address to fetch the
                dot data for display from the 3,000 byte DISPLAY BASE. The display
                data address is formed as follows:

            <p>
                In the standard bit map mode, color information is derived only
                fran the data stored in the video matrix (the color nybble is
                disregarded). These 8 bits are divided into two 4-bit nybbles,
                allowing two colors to be selected independently in each 8x8 dot
                block. When a bit in the display memory is a "0", the color of
                the output dot is set by the least significant (lower) nybble
                (LSN). Similarly, a display memory bit of "1" selects the output
                color specified by the MSN (upper nybble).

            <h3>MULTI-COLOR BIT MAP MODE</h3>
            <p>
                Multi-colored bit map mode is selected by setting the MCM bit in
                register 22 ($16) to a "1" in conjunction with the B W bit.
                Multi-color mode utilizes the same memory addressing sequence as
                standard bit map mode, but interpretes the display dot data
                differently.

                Note that the color nybble (DB11-DB8) IS used for the multi-color
                bit map mode. As in character multi-color mode, the horizontal
                dot size is doubled since two bits are required for color
                selection, resulting in a screen resolution of 160H x 200V.
                Utilizing multi-color bit map mode, three independently selected
                colors can be displayed in each 8 x 8 block in addition to the
                background color.

            <h3>MOVABLE IMAGE BLOCKS</h3>
            <p>
                The movable image block (MIB) is a special type of display image
                which can be displayed at any screen position without the 8x8 dot
                block constraints inherent in character and bit map modes. Up to 8
                unique MIBs can be displayed simultaneously, each defined by 63
                bytes in memory displayed as a 24x21 dot array (shown below). A
                number of special features make MIBs especially suited for video
                graphics and game applicatons.

            <h3>MIB ENABLE</h3>
            <p>
                Each MIB can be selectively enabled for display by setting its
                corresponding enable bit (MnE) to "1” in register 21 ($15). If
                the MnE bit is "0", the MIB will not be displayed.
            </p>

            <h3>MIB POSITION</h3>
            <p>
                Each MIB is positioned via its X and Y position register (see
                register map 1.3) within 512 horizontal and 256 vertical
                positions. The position of a MIB is specified by the upper-left
                corner of the array. X locations 23 to 347 (0x17-0x157) and Y
                locations 50 to 249 (0x32-0xF9) are visible. Since not all
                available MIB positions are entirely visible on the screen, MIBs
                may be moved smoothly on and off the display screen

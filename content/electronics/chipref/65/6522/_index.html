            <h2>MCS6522 VERSATILE INTERFACE ADAPTER</h2>

            <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>

            <p>
                The MCS6522 Versatile Interface Adapter (VIA) provides all of the capability of the MCS6520.
                In addition, this device contains a pair of very powerful interval timers, a serial-to-parallel/
                parallel-to-serial shift register and input data latching on the peripheral ports. Expanded
                handshaking capability allows control of bi-directional data transfers between VIA's in multiple
                processor systems.
            </p>
            <p>
                Control of peripheral devices is handled primarily through two 8-bit bi-directional ports.
                Each of these lines can be programmed to act as either an input or an output. Also, several
                peripheral I/O lines can be controlled directly from the interval timers for generating programmable-frequency square waves and for counting externally generated pulses. To facilitate
                control of the many powerful features of this chip, the internal registers have been organized
                into an interrupt flag register, an interrupt enable register and a pair of function control
                registers.

                The Peripheral A port consists of 8 lines which can be individually programmed to act as an input

                The polarity of output pins is controlled by
                an Output Register and input data can be latched into an internal register under control of the CA<sub>1</sub> line.
                All of these modes of operation are controlled by the system processor through the internal control
                registers.
                These lines represent one standard TTL load in the input mode and will drive one standard TTL
                load in the output mode.

                In addition, CA<sub>1</sub> controls the latching of data on Peripheral A Port input lines.
                The various modes of operation are controlled by the system processor through the internal control registers.
                CA<sub>1</sub> is a high-impedance input only while CA<sub>2</sub> represents one standard TTL load in the input mode.

                and a data direction register in much the same manner as the PA port.
                In addition, the polarity of the
                PB<sub>7</sub> output signal can be controlled by one of the interval timers while the second timer can be programmed to count pulses on the PB<sub>6</sub> pin.
                These lines represent one standard TTL load in the input mode
                and will drive one standard TTL load in the output mode.
                In addition, they are capable of sourcing 30 ma
                at 1.5 VDC in the output mode to allow the outputs to directly drive Darlington transistor switches.

            <p>
                The Chip Access Control contains the necessary logic to detect the chip select condition and to decode
                the Register Select inputs to allow accessing the desired internal register.
                In addition, the R/<span class="not">W</span> and âˆ…<sub>2</sub> signals are utilized to control the direction and timing of data transfers.
                When writing into the MCS6522, data is first latched into a date, input register during âˆ…<sub>2</sub>.
                Data is then transferred into the desired internal register during âˆ…<sub>2</sub> <span class="not">CS</span>.
                This allows the peripheral I/O line to change without "glitching."
                When the processor reads the MCS6522, data is transferred from the desired internal register
                directly onto the Data Bus during âˆ…<sub>2</sub>.

        <div class="col-12">
            <h4> PORT A REGISTERS, PORT B REGISTERS</h4>
            <p>
                Three registers are used in accessing each of the 8-bit peripheral, ports. Each port has a Data Direction
                Register (DDRA, DDRB) for specifying whether the peripheral pins are to act as inputs or outputs. A 0 in a bit
                of the Data Direction Register causes the corresponding peripheral pin to act as an input. A 1 causes the pin
                to act as an output.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each peripheral pin is also controlled by a bit in the Output Register (ORA, ORB) and an Input Register
                (IRA, IRB).
                When the pin is programmed to act as an output, the voltage on the pin is controlled by the corresponding bit of the Output Register.
                A 1 in the Output Register causes the pin to go high, and a 0 causes the pin to go low.
                Data can be written into Output Register bits corresponding to pins which are programmed to act
                as inputs; however, the pin will be unaffected.
            </p>
            <p>
                Reading a peripheral port causes the contents of the Input Register (IRA, IRB) to be transferred onto the
                Data Bus. With input latching disabled, IRA will always reflect the data on the PA pins. With input latching
                enabled, IRA will reflect the contents of the Port A prior to setting the CA1 Interrupt Flag (IFRl) by an
                active transition on CA<sub>1</sub>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The IRB register operates in a similar manner. However, for output pins, the corresponding IRB bit will
                reflect the contents of the Output Register bit instead of the actual pin. This allows proper data to be read
                into the processor if the output pin is not allowed to go to full voltage. With input latching enabled on
                Port B, setting CB<sub>1</sub> interrupt flag will cause IRB to latch this combination of input data and ORB data until
                the interrupt flag is cleared.

            <h4>HANDSHAKE CONTROL</h4>
            <p>
                The MCS6522 allows very positive control of data transfers between the system processor and peripheral
                devices through the operation of "handshake" lines. Port A lines (CA1, CA2) handshake data on both a read and
                a write operation while the Port B lines (CB1, CB2) handshake on a write operation only.

            <h5>Read Handshake</h5>
            <p>
                Positive control of data transfers from peripheral devices into the system processor can be accomplished
                very effectively using "Read" handshaking. In this case, the peripheral device must generate "Data Ready" to
                signal the processor that valid data is present on the peripheral port. This signal normally interrupts the
                processor, which then reads the data, causing generation of a "Data Taken" signal. The peripheral device responds
                by making new data available. This process continues until the data transfer is complete.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the MCS6522, automatic "Read" handshaking is possible on the Peripheral A port only. The CAl interrupt
                input pin accepts the "Data Ready" signal and CA2 generates the "Data Taken" signal. The Data Ready signal will
                set an internal flag which may interrupt the processor or which can be polled under software control. The Data
                Taken signal can be either a pulse or a DC level which is set low by the system processor and is cleared by the
                Data Ready signal. These options are shown in Figure 3 which illustrates the normal Read Handshaking sequence.

            <h5>Write Handshake</h5>
            <p>
                The sequence of operations which allows handshaking data from the system processor to a peripheral device
                is very similar to that described in Section A for Read Handshaking.
                However, for "Write" handshaking, the processor must generate the "Data Ready" signal (through the MCS6522) and the peripheral device must respond with
                the "Data Taken" signal. This can be accomplished on both the PA port and the PB port on the MCS6522.
                CA<sub>2</sub> or CB<sub>2</sub> acts as a Data Ready output in either the DC level or pulse mode and CA<sub>1</sub> or CB<sub>1</sub> accepts the "Data Taken"
                signal from the peripheral device, setting the interrupt flag and clearing the "Data Ready" output. This sequence is shown in Figure 4.

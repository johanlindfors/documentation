    <p>
        OSBYTE calls are a powerful and flexible way of invoking many of the available operating system facilities.
    </p>
    <p>
        OSBYTE calls are specified by the contents of the accumulator (A register) in the 6502. This means that up to
        256 different calls can be made.
    </p>
    <p>
        The command line interpreter (see section 2.11) performs OSBYTE calls in response to *FX commands. This enables
        the user to make OSBYTE calls from the keyboard or within BASIC programs. It should be noted however that no
        results are returned by a *FX call and so it is inappropriate to use certain OSBYTEs in this way.

<h3>Shadow mode</h3>
<p>
  Shadow mode is the option to force all screen's to use Shadow memory.
  By default it is disabled so that mode's 0..7 on the BBC Micro will use system memory whilst modes 128..135 will use
  shadow memory.
</p>
<p>
  When shadow mode is enabled all modes use shadow memory.
  e.g. 0..7 will have 128 added to give 128..135.

    <p>
        The OSWORD routines are very similar in concept to the OSBYTE routines. The major difference arises in the way
        of passing parameters. Instead of being passed in the X and Y registers, they are placed in a parameter block,
        The address of this parameter block is sent to the routine in the X (for the low byte) and Y (for the high byte)
        registers.

    <h3>Entry parameters</h3>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>A</th>
            <td>OSWORD routine ID</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>X</th>
            <td>Low byte of paameter block address</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Y</th>
            <td>High byte of paameter block address</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
        OSWORD ID's in the range &E0..&FF (224..255) are passed to ther USERV (&200) handler with the registers
        unchanged to the original OSWORD call.
    </p>
    <p>
        All other unrecognised OSWORD calls are offered to the paged ROMs.

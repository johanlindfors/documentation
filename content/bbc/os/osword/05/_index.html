<p>
  A byte of I/O processor memory may be read or written across the Tube using this call.
  A 32 bit address should be contained in memory at the address contained in the X and Y registers.
</p>

<p>For writes (OSWord 0x06) the value to write should be placed in XY+4</p>

<p>For reads (OSWord 0x05) the value read is placed in XY+4 on exit.</p>

  If the I/O processor uses 16 bit memory addressing only least significant two bytes need to be specified.

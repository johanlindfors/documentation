<p>
  On the BBC Micro addresses 0x0000&hellip;0x008F are reserved for the current language.
  The table above lists the known BASIC II memory map for those addresses.
</p>
<p>
  BBC Basic reserves 0x0070&hellip;0x008F for user programs.
  User code should not use addresses outside that range unless they have replaced BASIC.

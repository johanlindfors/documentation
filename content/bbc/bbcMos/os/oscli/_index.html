<p>
    This call provides the machine code user with a convenient method of performing any of the * commands that the
    system provides from Basic.
</p>
<p>
    The command required is placed in a string as normal text terminated by a CR character and this call is made with the address in X & Y.
</p>
<p>
    If the string passed to the CLI is not terminated by a carriage return within 255 bytes this routine has undefined
    effects.
</p>
<p>
    The OS provides a default set of commands:
    <em>(Note these have * in them but that is not necessary when passing the command to OSCLI)</em>

    These commands may be abbreviated by taking the first few letters and terminating with a ‘.’ character. Parameters
    may be passed in the text following the command.
</p>
<p>
    Other unrecognised commands are first offered to paged ROMs and are then offered to the currently
    selected filing system via the filing system control vector.

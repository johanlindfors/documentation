<p>
  This routine takes a specified number of characters from the currently selected input stream.
</p>
<p>
  Input is terminated following a RETURN or an ESCAPE. DELETE (&7F/127) deletes the previous character and CTRL U
  (&15/21) deletes the entire line.
</p>
<p>
  If characters are presented after the maximum line length has been reached the characters are ignored and a BEL (ASCII
  7) character is output.
</p>
<p>
  OSWORD 0x00 is the only OSWord which return's data in the registers.

<p>
    This table relates to a BBC Model B with Acorn DFS active.
    This will use pages 0x0E to 0x18 with the USER workspace starting at page 0x19.
</p>

<p>
    This does NOT apply when either the Cassette or ROM filesystem is active,
    or on a BBC Master 128.
    In those cases USER workspace starts at page 0x0E.

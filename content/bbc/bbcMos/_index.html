  <p>
    This section is where the user documentation for your project lives - all the information your users need to
    understand and successfully use your project.
  </p>
  <p>
    For large documentation sets we recommend adding content under the headings in this section, though if some or all
    of them donâ€™t apply to your project feel free to remove them or add your own. You can see an example of a smaller
    Docsy documentation site in the [Docsy User Guide](https://docsy.dev/docs/), which lives in the [Docsy theme
    repo](https://github.com/google/docsy/tree/master/userguide) if you'd like to copy its docs section.
  </p>
  <p>
    Other content such as marketing material, case studies, and community updates should live in the [About](/about/)
    and [Community](/community/) pages.
  </p>
  <p>
    Find out how to use the Docsy theme in the [Docsy User Guide](https://docsy.dev/docs/). You can learn more about how
    to organize your documentation (and how we organized this site) in [Organizing Your
    Content](https://docsy.dev/docs/best-practices/organizing-content/).

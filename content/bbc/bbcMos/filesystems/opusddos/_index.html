<p>
    This is a double density format, but it is mentioned here as the volume catalogues are based on
    <a href="../dfs/">Acorn DFS</a>.
</p>
<p>
    DDOS discs are partitioned into between one and eight volumes. Track 0 is reserved for the DFS-style volume
    catalogues, plus a disc catalogue unique to DDOS.
</p>
<p>
    In each volume catalogue:
<ul>
    <li>The start sector may be any number less than the disc size, as DDOS adds a partition offset and so the
        catalogue is not in the same space as the files.
    </li>
    <li>The disc size is the size of the current volume. It is an 11 bit quantity, the top bit being in bit 2 of
        sector 1 byte 6.
        <br/><strong>If and only if this bit is set:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>The file length steals an extra bit from the execution address of each file (bit 6 of sector 1 byte
                14+n.)
            </li>
            <li>The start sector steals an extra bit from the load address of each file (bit 2 of sector 1 byte
                14+n.)
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

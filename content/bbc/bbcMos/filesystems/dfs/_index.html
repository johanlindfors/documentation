<h2>Physical format</h2>
<p>
    Acorn DFS is a single sided, single density 40 or 80 track format.
    A double sided disc can hold two DFS volumes.
    Each track carries ten 256 byte sectors numbered from 0 to 9.
</p>

<h3>Sector ID's</h3>
<p>
    Each sector is given an ID at format time; the parameters of the ID, listed below, are used by the DFS and the
    floppy
    disc controller to address sectors.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        C, the cylinder number ranges from 0 on the outermost track to 39 or 79 on the innermost track.
    </li>
    <li>
        H, the head number = 0.
        Acorn DFS ignores this after formatting.<br/>
        Some DFS formatters set it to 1 on the upper surface of the disc (corresponding to drives 2 or 3.)
    </li>
    <li>
        R, the record number runs sequentially from 0 to 9 within each track.<br/>
        There is a standard track skew of 3;
        that is, the sectors having R = 0 are the first sector of the first track,
        the fourth sector of the second track, the seventh of the third, the tenth of the fourth, and so on.
    </li>
    <li>
        N, the record length = 1, showing that the sector length is 27 + 1, or 256 bytes.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    All these parameters can potentially take any value between 0 and 255, and so confuse Acorn DFS and some
    non-standard controllers.
    Some copy protection schemes make use of this feature.

    <h2>Catalog</h2>

    <p>
        The catalog is located in sectors 0 & 1 on Track 0. It is capable of holding just 31 entries.
    </p>

    <p>
        Formatting a disk on the real hardware only needs to write to these two sectors (via `*FORM40` or `*FORM80`) but
        a blank catalogue simply needs these two sectors blanked and the disk size field initialised.
    </p>

    <h4>File descriptor fields</h4>
    <p>
        There is room for 31 file entries in the catalogue.
        Each entry takes up eight bytes in each of the two catalogue sectors.
    </p>

    <p>
        Files must be listed in descending order of start sector with no gaps in the catalogue.
        Empty files should be given a start sector of 2.
        Files cannot be fragmented but there may be free sectors between files.
    </p>

    <p>
        The rest of each sector represents the files. Each file is represented by a block of 8 bytes in each sector
        offset by 8.
        So the last file starts at offset 8, second to last at 16 & so on.

        One valid file name character stored in the low 7 bits of sector 0 byte 15 Identifies the directory
        (namespace) to which the file belongs.
    </p>
    <p>
        DFS directories are like those in ADFS, DOS or Linux except they cannot nest (they are all root
        directories) and they share the volume catalogue.
    </p>
    <p>
        The combination of file name and directory must be unique in the volume.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="printPageBreakAvoid">
    <h4>Locked Attribute</h4>
    <p>
        If the top bit of the directory is set, then the file is locked and may not be altered or
        deleted.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="printPageBreakAvoid">
    <h4>Load address</h4>
    <p>
        An 18 bit address in memory where the file should be *LOADed by default.
        The low 8 bits are in sector 1 byte 8;
        the next 8 bits in sector 1 byte 9; the top two bits are in bits 2 and 3 of sector 1 byte 14.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the file is not meant for *LOADing (e.g. a sequential file or text) all 18 bits should be set.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="printPageBreakAvoid">
    <h4>Execution address</h4>
    <p>
        An 18 bit address in memory to be jumped to when the file is *RUN.
        This need not be within the bounds of the loaded file.
        The low 8 bits are in sector 1 byte 10; the next 8 bits in sector 1 byte 11; the top two bits are
        in bits 6 and 7 of sector 1 byte 14.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the file is a sequential file or text then all 18 bits should be set.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="printPageBreakAvoid">
    <h4>File length</h4>
    <p>
        An 18 bit value giving the number of bytes in the file.
    </p>
    <p>
        The low 8 bits are in sector 1 byte 12; the next 8 bits
        in sector 1 byte 13; the top two bits are in bits 4 and 5 of sector 1 byte 14.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="printPageBreakAvoid">
    <h4>Start sector</h4>
    <p>
        The 10 bit logical block address of the first sector that contains the file.
        The low 8 bits are in sector 1 byte 15; the top two bits are in bits 0 and 1 of sector 1 byte 14.
        The cylinder and record numbers are the result and remainder, respectively, when the LBA is divided by 10.
    </p>
    <p>
        A start sector of 0 or 1 is invalid as the file would overlap the catalogue.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="printPageBreakAvoid">
    <h4>Note on load and execution addresses</h4>
    <p>
        If bits 16 and 17 of the address are both set, the address refers to I/O processor memory and OSFILE
        will return the address ORed with &FFFF0000 in its parameter block.
    </p>
    <p>
        Otherwise it is an address in second processor memory and OSFILE will return the address as is.
    </p>
    <p>
        In practice the bits are sometimes found clear when they should be set.

    <h4>Issues with early versions of DFS</h4>
    <p>
        Some early DFSs allow the user to write disk titles or filenames with bit 7 set.
    </p>
    <p>
        This may cause these entries to appear to erroneously have
        <a href="../hdfs/">HDFS</a> or
        <a href="../wdfs/">WDFS</a> attributes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most DFSs disallow top-bit set filenames and disk titles.

    <h2>Identifying and validating a DFS disc image</h2>
    <p>
        Unlike its successor ADFS, the DFS format contains no self-identification strings or checksums, so recognising a
        disc or disc image as Acorn DFS is a complex and unreliable process.
    </p>
    <p>
        If one has a floppy disc in hand it is often enough to confirm that the physical format is the same (see above)
        as Acorn DFS is the majority producer. On the other hand DFS disc image files are normally given the extension
        .ssd or .dsd, indicating a single or double sided disc image respectively.
    </p>
    <p>
        Often the task is to identify which format variant a disc or image contains. This is more a matter of finding
        valid catalogues in the appropriate locations.
    </p>

<div class="printPageBreakAvoid">
    <h3>To check that a pair of sectors contains a valid standard DFS catalogue</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Firstly confirm that all bits marked white or cream in the above diagram are zeroes; if not, the catalogue
            can be rejected immediately.
        </li>
        <li>Check also that the file offset is a multiple of 8.</li>
        <li>The disc size must be between 2 and 800 sectors inclusive, although the format allows up to 1023 sectors,
            and disk images may contain up to this many.
        </li>
        <li>The disc title consists of printable ASCII characters, padded with NULs or spaces.</li>
        <li>For each file entry in use:
            <ul>
                <li>The file name field must contain one to seven valid characters and be padded with spaces. Valid
                    characters are the printable ASCII characters between &20 and &7E inclusive, except . : " # * and
                    space.
                </li>
                <li>The directory character (without the attribute bit) must be a valid file name character.</li>
                <li>The file name (taking the directory character into account) must be unique.</li>
                <li>The start sector must be more than 1 and less than the disc size.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Skipping over zero-length files:
            <ul>
                <li>The start sectors must run in strictly descending order.</li>
                <li>No file may overlap the one before it in the catalogue. That is, start_sector_2 + ((length_2 + 255)
                    DIV 256) ≤ start_sector_1.
                </li>
                <li>No file may overshoot the end of the disc. That is, start_sector + ((length + 255) DIV 256) ≤
                    disc_size. Equivalently, the first file in the catalogue must not overlap the imaginary file whose
                    start sector field is the disc size field.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Further heuristics</h3>
    <p>
        Any catalogue complying with the above is a valid DFS catalogue; however, only a tiny subset of these look like
        catalogues seen in real life. As an informal test a pair of sectors that match many of the following is more
        likely to be a catalogue:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The disc size is 400 sectors (40 tracks) or 800 sectors (80 tracks.)</li>
        <li>There is a file named !BOOT in directory $.</li>
        <li>The 16th and 17th bits of the load and execution (exec) addresses are all clear or all set in each file
            entry.
        </li>
        <li>There are few directories, or a few unique names in several directories.</li>
        <li>Most directory characters are $ (the default.)</li>
        <li>Some files have load addresses of the form &3nn00 (nn=0E, 11, 19, 1B, 1D, 1F or 21) and exec addresses of
            &3801F or &38023. (BASIC programs.)
        </li>
        <li>Some files have load and exec addresses the same, usually &xx00 or &3xx00, and often have length &yy00.
            (Screen dumps and machine code images.)
        </li>
        <li>Some files have load and exec addresses of 0, &30000 or &3FFFF (Text and sequential data.)</li>
        <li>Many files are less than 2K; few files more than 20K; no files more than 64K except text and sequential
            data.
        </li>
        <li>The file names have very few lowercase letters.</li>
        <li>The file names contain commonly-occurring pairs of letters.</li>
    </ul>

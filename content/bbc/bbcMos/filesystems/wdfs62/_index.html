<p>
    Watford 62 DFS is identical to <a href="../wdfs/">Watford DFS</a> except it places a second catalogue in
    sectors 2 and 3 of track 0, allowing 62 files on one volume.
    To identify the second catalogue it sets its title to 12 Ã— &AA bytes.
</p>
<p>
    Without due care a system running <a href="../dfs/">Acorn DFS</a> can corrupt a Watford disc as it is unaware of the
    extra files.
    On such a system the user may run a <code>*SWAP</code> utility to exchange the catalogues.
    In practice there is a special entry in the first catalogue (directory !, name !!!!!!!, length &200, start sector 2)
    protecting the second one from being overwritten.
</p>
<p>
    If any file in the first catalogue starts before sector 4, and it is not the special file, the disc is not a Watford
    DFS disc.

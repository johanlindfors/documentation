<p>
    The contents of the low-order four bits (bits 3, 2, 1, and 0) of the memory location (HL) are copied to the high-order four bits (7, 6, 5, and 4) of that same memory location;
    the previous contents of those high-order four bits are copied to the low-order four bits of the Accumulator (Register A);
    and the previous contents of the low-order four bits of the Accumulator are copied to the low-order four bits of memory location (HL).
    The contents of the high-order bits of the Accumulator are unaffected.

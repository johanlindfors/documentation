<p>
    The contents of the low-order four bits (bits 3, 2, 1, and 0) of memory location (HL) are copied to the low-order four bits of the Accumulator (Register A).
    The previous contents of the low-order four bits of the Accumulator are copied to the high-order four bits (7, 6, 5, and 4) of location (HL);
    and the previous contents of the high-order four bits of (HL) are copied to the low-order four bits of (HL).
    The contents of the high-order bits of the Accumulator are unaffected.

<p>
  The Block transfer instructions allow for data to be moved around in memory.
</p>

<p>
  The programmer needs to configure the 16 bit registers to define the properties of the move:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>HL</code> is the source address to copy from</li>
  <li><code>DE</code> is the destination address to copy from</li>
  <li><code>BC</code> is the number of bytes to copy</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The instructions then perform the equivalent of the following:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Copy a byte of memory from <code>(HL)</code> to <code>(DE)</code></li>
  <li>Decrement BC by one</li>
  <li>HL and DE are either incremented (for LDI/LDIR) or decremented (for LDD/LDDR) by one.</li>
  <li>The LDIR and LDDR instructions will loop back to step one if BC is not 0</li>
</ol>

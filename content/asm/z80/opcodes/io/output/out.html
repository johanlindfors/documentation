<p>
    <strong>D</strong> 0=Increment, 1=Decrement <code>HL</code> after each iteration
</p>
<p>
    <strong>L</strong> If set then if \(B \not = 0\) then \(PC \longleftarrow PC-2\) so that the
    instruction is repeated.
</p>

<p>
    The contents of Register C are placed on the bottom half (A0&hellip;A7) of the address
    bus to select the I/O device at one of 256 possible ports.
</p>
<p>
    Register B can be used as a byte counter, and its contents are placed on the top half (A8&hellip;15)
    of the address bus at this time.
</p>
<p>
    Then one byte from the address pointed to by <code>HL</code> is placed on the data bus and written to the port.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, the byte counter is decremented and register pair HL is incremented.

    The contents of Register C are placed on the bottom half (A0&hellip;7) of the address bus to select the I/O device at one of 256 possible ports.
</p>
<p>
    The contents of Register B are placed on the top half (A8&hellip;A15) of the address bus at this time.
</p>
<p>
<p>
    Then the byte contained in r is placed on the data bus and written to the selected peripheral device.
</p>

<div class="alert-info">
  <p>
    There is an <a href="../../undocumented/">undocumented</a> code where r=%110 which writes the flag register.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unlike it's <a href="../inrc/">IN F, (C)</a> counterpart, this instruction is completely undocumented, but it's here
    not in the undocumented section to be consistent.

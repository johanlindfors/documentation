{{< /z80/instruction >}}
<p>
    The contents of Register C are placed on the bottom half (A0&hellip;7) of the address bus to select the I/O device at one of 256 possible ports.
</p>
<p>
    The contents of Register B are placed on the top half (A8&hellip;A15) of the address bus at this time.
</p>
<p>
<p>
    Then the byte contained in r is placed on the data bus and written to the selected peripheral device.

<h3>Undocumented OP Codes</h3>
<p>
  For <code>OUT (C), r</code> there's an undocumented code where r=%110 which writes the flag register.

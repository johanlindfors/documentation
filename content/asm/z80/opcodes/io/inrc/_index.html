{{< z80/instruction
    operation="r \longleftarrow (C)"
    def="11101101 ED/01r000"
>}}
{{< /z80/instruction >}}
<p>
    The contents of Register C are placed on the bottom half (A0&hellip;7) of the address bus to select the I/O device at one of 256 possible ports.
</p>
<p>
    The contents of Register B are placed on the top half (A8&hellip;A15) of the address bus at this time.
</p>
<p>
    Then one byte from the selected port is placed on the data bus and written to register r in the CPU.
</p>
<h3>Undocumented OP Codes</h3>
<p>
    For <code>IN r, (C)</code> there's an undocumented code where r=%110 which sets the flag register.
</p>
<p>
    For an undocumented code, this is actually in Zilog's Z80 CPU User Manual, 2016 edition Page 296
    so isn't that "undocumented".

<p>
    This instruction places <em>n</em> onto the bottom half (A0&hellip;A7) of the address bus to select
    the I/O device at one of 256 possible ports.
</p>
<p>
    The contents of the Accumulator also appear on the top half (A8&hellip;A15) of the address bus at this time.
</p>
<p>
    Then the byte contained in the Accumulator is placed on the data bus and written to the selected peripheral device.

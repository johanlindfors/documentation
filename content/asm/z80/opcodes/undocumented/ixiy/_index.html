<p>
    If an opcode works with the Registers HL, H or L then if that opcode is prefixed by 0xDD then it will also
    work on the appropriate IX, IX<sub>h</sub> or IX<sub>l</sub> registers, with some exceptions.
</p>
<p>
    The 0xFD prefix would also work but for the IY, IY<sub>h</sub> or IY<sub>l</sub> registers
</p>
<p>
    The exceptions are instructions like <code>LD H,IX<sub>h</sub></code> or <code>LD L,IY<sub>h</sub></code> where it
    isn't clear from the opcode which register the 0xFD or 0xDD prefix should operate against.

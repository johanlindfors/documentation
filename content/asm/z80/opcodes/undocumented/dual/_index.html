<p>
    There are a few undocumented instructions that performs an action and then copies the result into a register.
</p>
<p>
    For example the official <code>RLC (IX+nn)</code><sub>0xDDCBnn06</sub> instruction operates on a specific memory address,
    however the undocumented <code>RLC B,(IX+nn)</code><sub>0xDDCBnn00</sub> instruction does the same thing but then
    copies the result into the B register.

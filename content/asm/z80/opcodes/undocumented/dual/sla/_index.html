<p>
  This instruction performs an <code>SLA (IX+dd)</code> or <code>SLA (IX+dd)</code> operation but then also stores
  the result in a register as well as in the memory location.

  Note: r=%110 does exist. It doesn't do a copy into a register as it's the existing official, documented instruction.

<p>
  Similar to the <code>RES</code> and <code>SET</code> instructions, there are undocumented instructions for
  <code>BIT</code>.
  Unlike the other, as BIT only tests a bit and does not change anything, these opcodes have the same behaviour to
  the officially documented BIT instruction.
</p>

{{< z80/instruction
def="/q Z \longleftarrow \overline{(IX+d)_b}/l BIT b, (IX+d)/11011101 DD/11001011 CB/d/01br//q Z \longleftarrow \overline{(IY+d)_b}/l BIT b, (IY+d)/11111101 FD/11001011 CB/d/01br"
>}}
{{< /z80/instruction >}}
<p>
  Z is set if the specified bit in the source is 0, otherwise it is cleared.
</p>

<p>
  r=%110 does exist, it is the official, documented operation.
</p>

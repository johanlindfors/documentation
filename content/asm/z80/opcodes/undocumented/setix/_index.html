<p>There are a few undocumented instructions that performs an action and then copies the result into a register.</p>
<p>
For example the official <code>SET 0,(IX+nn)</code> instruction sets bit 0 on a specific memory address,
however the undocumented <code>SET B,0,(IX+nn)</code><sub>0xDDCBnn00</sub> instruction does the same thing but then
copies the result into the B register.
</p>
{{< z80/instruction operation="(IX+d)_b \longleftarrow 0 \\ r \longleftarrow (IX+d)" def="11111101 DD/11001011 CB/d/11br" >}}{{< /z80/instruction >}}
<p>Z is set if the specified bit in the source is 0, otherwise it is cleared.</p>
<p>The result is stored both in memory and the specified register.</p>
<p>r=%110 does exist, it is the official documented operation with no auto-copy to a register.</p>

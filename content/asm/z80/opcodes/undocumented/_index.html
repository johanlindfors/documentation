<p>
    Like most early microprocessors, the Z80 has it's own set of undocumented instructions.
</p>
<p>
    Most of these either do something that's not useful, or they do something that would at first seem
    to be odd in why they were implemented in the first place.
</p>
<p>
    In most instances, they exist due to how the processor is implemented in silicon.
    Where an instruction is decoded, there are free bits so if something tried to use that code then
    the processor would just do as it's told as it wouldn't know otherwise.
</p>

    <p>
        Be aware, these usually work on a physical chip due to it requiring the actual instruction decoding to
        provide these instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
        They will most likely not work in an emulator as they would perform the decoding in software using lookup
        tables, so wouldn't implement anything that's not documented.
    </p>
</div>
<p>
    These may or may not work on actual chips.
    For example, on the 6502 there were plenty of undocumented instructions that were replaced in the 65C02 with
    NOP instructions.

    These are provided here for reference only.

    <h3>When is undocumented actually documented?</h3>
    <p>
        One oddity is the undocumented instruction <code>IN F,(C)</code><sub>0xED70</sub> which performs an IN from an
        I/O
        port but stores the result into the Flags register.
    </p>
    <p>
        This instruction is actually documented in Zilogs own documentation (2016 PDF).
    </p>
    <p>
        For this reason, that instruction is listed on the <code>IN r,(C)</code> page and not in this section.

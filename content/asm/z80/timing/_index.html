<p>
    The Z80 processor executes instructions as a series of basic operations:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Memory access</li>
    <li>I/O device access</li>
    <li>Interrupt acknowledge</li>
</ul>
<h3>Machine Cycles</h3>
<p>
    Each of these operations is known as a Machine cycle (<code>M-cycle</code>).
    An <code>M-cycle</code> however can take between 3 and 6 clock cycles to execute.
</p>

<h3>Time Cycles</h3>
<p>
    A time cycle (<code>T-cycle</code>) is one cycle of the system clock, from

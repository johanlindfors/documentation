<p>
    The Z80 processor executes instructions as a series of basic operations:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Memory access</li>
    <li>I/O device access</li>
    <li>Interrupt acknowledge</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Each of these operations is known as a Machine cycle (<code>M-cycle</code>),
    which can take between 3 and 6 <code>T-Cycles</code> to execute,
    although this can be extended by the <span class="not">WAIT</span> signal.
    A <code>T-cycle</code> (Time Cycle) is one cycle of the system clock.
</p>
<p>
    The following diagram shows an example of a single instruction that reads from memory and writes back.

<h3>Opcode fetch</h3>
<p>
    The Opcode fetch takes 4 T-cycles:

<p>
    T1 Sets the Address bus <code>A<sub>0&hellip;15</sub></code> to the current value of the program counter.<br/>
    T2 Reads the opcode during the second half of the cycle.<br/>
    T3 and T4 has the refresh address set on the Address Bus. This is to allow dynamic ram to be refreshed.

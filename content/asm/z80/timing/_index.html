<p>
    The Z80 processor executes instructions as a series of basic operations:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Memory access</li>
    <li>I/O device access</li>
    <li>Interrupt acknowledge</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Each of these operations is known as a Machine cycle (<code>M-cycle</code>),
    which can take between 3 and 6 <code>T-Cycles</code> to execute,
    although this can be extended by the <span class="not">WAIT</span> signal.
    A <code>T-cycle</code> (Time Cycle) is one cycle of the system clock.
</p>
<p>
    The following diagram shows an example of a single instruction that reads from memory and writes back.

    <h3>Opcode fetch</h3>
    <p>
        The Opcode fetch takes 4 T-cycles:

    </div>

    <p>
        T1 Sets the Address bus <code>A<sub>0&hellip;15</sub></code> to the current value of the program counter.<br/>
        T2 Reads the opcode during the second half of the cycle.<br/>
        T3 and T4 has the refresh address set on the Address Bus. This is to allow dynamic ram to be refreshed.
    </p>

    <h3>Memory Access</h3>
    <p>
        Memory access cycles are generally three T-cycles long unless wait states are requested by memory via the
        <span class="not">WAIT</span> signal.
    </p>

    <h4>Memory Read Cycle</h4>
    <p>
        For a memory read the <span class="not">MREQ</span> and <span class="not">RD</span> signals are pulled low once
        the address bus is stable.
    </p>

    </div>

<div class="printPageBreakAvoid">
    <h4>Memory Write Cycle</h4>
    <p>
        For a memory write the <span class="not">MREQ</span> and <span class="not">WR</span> signals are pulled low once
        the address bus is stable.
    </p>
    <div class="ml-2">
        <img src="/asm/z80/timing/memwrite.svg" alt="Visualisation of the timing of writing to memory"/>
    </div>
    <p>
        <span class="not">WR</span> goes inactive half a T-State before the address and data bus contents are changed
        to support different types of memory.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="printPageBreakAvoid">
    <h3>I/O Cycles</h3>
    <p>
        I/O operations are similar to memory, except the <span class="not">IORQ</span> signal is used instead of
        <span class="not">MREQ</span> to indicate that devices not memory should respond.
    </p>
    <p>
        Also an additional wait state is inserted after T-State 2.
        The reason for this single wait state insertion is that during I/O operations, the period from when the
        <span class="not">IORQ</span> signal goes active until the CPU must sample the <span class="not">WAIT</span>
        line is short.
        Without this extra state, sufficient time does not exist for an I/O port to decode its address and activate the
        <span class="not">WAIT</span> line if a wait is required.
        Additionally, without this wait state, it is difficult to design MOS I/O devices that can operate at full CPU
        speed.
        During this wait state period, the <span class="not">WAIT</span> request signal is sampled.
    </p>

    <h4>I/O Read Cycle</h4>
    <p>
        During a read I/O operation, the <span class="not">RD</span> line is used to enable the addressed port onto the
        data bus, just as in the case of a memory read.

    <h4>I/O Write Cycle</h4>
    <p>
        During a write I/O operation, the <span class="not">WR</span> line is used to enable the addressed port onto the
        data bus, just as in the case of a memory write.

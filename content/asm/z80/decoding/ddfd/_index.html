<p>
    Instructions with either the <code>DD</code> or <code>FD</code> prefixes affect those instructions that operate
    against the memory addressed by <code>HL</code>,
    changing them to use either the <code>IX</code> or <code>IY</code> registers with an offset.
</p>
<p>
    Instructions that refer directly to the <code>HL</code> register will then act directly against either
    <code>IX</code> or <code>IY</code>.
    For those that refer to <code>(HL)</code>, i.e. the memory pointed to by <code>HL</code>
    then the instructions use an additional relative offset that's added to either the
    <code>IX</code> or <code>IY</code> registers, and are written as
    <code>(IX+d)</code> or <code>(IY+d)</code>.
</p>

<p>
    Instructions with the <code>DD</code> prefix use the <code>IX</code> register,
    whilst the <code>FD</code> prefix uses the <code>IY</code> register.
</p>

<h2>DDCB and FDCB Prefixes</h2>
<p>
    The <code>DD</code> and <code>FD</code> prefixes extends though the <code>CB</code> prefix as it does for normal instructions.
    Just like the <a href="../cb/">CB</a> prefix
</p>

<p>
    The format of the instruction also changes slightly as they change the behaviour of the existing instructions with
    the <code>CB</code> prefix.
    These instructions are all four bytes long with the third byte consisting of the offset.
</p>
<p>
    For example: The <code>RLC (HL)</code> is encoded as <span class="hex">CB06</span>.
</p>
<p>
    With the <code>DD</code> prefix this becomes <code>RLC (IX+d)</code> but the instruction is formatted as
    <span class="hex">DDCBdd06</span>.
    With the <code>FD</code> prefix this becomes <code>RLC (IY+d)</code>, formatted as
    <span class="hex">FDCBdd06</span>.
</p>
<p>
    Note that the offset <code>d</code> is before the final part of the operand, not after as you might expect.
</p>

<h3>Decoder</h3>
<p>
    All of these have either DD or FD as the previous prefix byte and a displacement immediately after them.

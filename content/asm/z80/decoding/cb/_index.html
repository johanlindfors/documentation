<p>
    Instructions with the CB prefix consist of instructions that manipulate individual bits in a register or memory.

    <h3>Operations with IX and IY registers</h3>
    <p>
        The operations here which operator on the <code>(HL)</code> register do also support use with the
        <code>IX</code> and <code>IY</code> registers with a relative offset.
        They are identical to the <code>(HL)</code> operation but with a <a href="../ddfd/">DD</a> or
        <a href="../ddfd/">FD</a> prefix.
    </p>

    <p>
        Only instructions with the lower nibble set to 6 or E are documented.
        The other opcodes are <a href="../../opcodes/undocumented/">undocumented</a>.

        Op codes <span class="hex">CB30</span>&hellip;<span class="hex">CB37</span> are undocumented;
        but they do perform a <a href="../../opcodes/undocumented/sll">shift left operation</a>, placing a 1 in bit 0 and setting the carry flag to the original bit 7.

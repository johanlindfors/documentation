<p>
    This section lists how the instructions are laid out at the bit level.
</p>
<p>
    Normally if you are manually disassembling code you just need to use the
    <a href="../reference/opcodes/">list by Opcodes</a>, however this section will be useful if you are implementing
    a Z80 emulator as you can see how the instruction decoding works including how the undocumented instructions work
    due to how the bits are organised.
</p>

<p>
    You can use the table below as a starting point.
</p>

<p>
    To decode an instruction:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        If the opcode is <a href="cb/">CB</a> then go to that prefix page and decode the next byte.
    </li>
    <li>
        If the opcode is <a href="ddfd/">DD</a>,  or <a href="ddfd/">FD</a> then decode the next byte from this table,
        but the final instruction will replace HL with either IX or IY depending on the code.
    </li>
    <li>
        Using the table below, locate the pattern that matches the opcode.
        It's usually best to start from the left (bit 7) and go right until you find the opcode.
        <p>
            An <code>X</code> means a bit that can be either 0 or 1, however check adjacent rows first and always take
            an entry that has a 0 or 1 as higher precedence to the X.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>

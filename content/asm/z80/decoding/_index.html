<p>
    This section lists how the instructions are laid out at the bit level.
</p>
<p>
    Normally if you are manually disassembling code you just need to use the
    <a href="../reference/opcodes/">list by Opcodes</a>, however this section will be useful if you are implementing
    a Z80 emulator as you can see how the instruction decoding works including how the undocumented instructions work
    due to how the bits are organised.
</p>

<h3>How to use these decoding tables</h3>
<p>
    To decode an opcode, convert it to binary then run through it from left to right, e.g. start at Bit&nbsp;7 and move
    towards Bit&nbsp;0.
</p>
<p>
    As you run through the bits, start on the table from the top-left and go down then right as you find each bit.
    Bits are ordered with 0 first, then 1 & finally x which indicates that bit can be either 0 or 1.
</p>
<p>
    When you find a match then go with that.
    If more than one entry matches then go for the one higher in the table as that will have higher precedence.
</p>

<h2>Z80 Instruction Decode table</h2>

<p>
    To decode an instruction:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        If the opcode is <a href="cb/">CB</a>, <a href="ddfd/">DD</a>, <a href="ed/">ED</a> or <a href="ddfd/">FD</a>
        then go to that prefix page and decode the next byte.
    </li>
    <li>
        Using the table below, locate the pattern that matches the opcode.
        It's usually best to start from the left (bit 7) and go right until you find the opcode.
        <p>
            An <code>X</code> means a bit that can be either 0 or 1, however check adjacent rows first and always take
            an entry that has a 0 or 1 as higher precedence to the X.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>

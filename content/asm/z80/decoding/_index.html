<p>
    This section lists how the instructions are laid out at the bit level.
</p>
<p>
    Normally if you are manually disassembling code you just need to use the
    <a href="../reference/opcodes/">list by Opcodes</a>, however this section will be useful if you are implementing
    a Z80 emulator as you can see how the instruction decoding works including how the undocumented instructions work
    due to how the bits are organised.

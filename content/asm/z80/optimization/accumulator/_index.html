<h2>Setting the Accumulator to 0</h2>
<p>
    When dealing with loading 0 into the Accumulator, there's several ways to do it.
</p>

{{< book/sourceCode>}}
{{< book/asm op="LD" param="A,0" code="3E00" comment="Traditional way to set A to 0" >}}
{{< book/asm op="XOR" param="A" code="AF" comment="Anything xor itself is 0" >}}
{{< book/asm op="SUB" param="A" code="97" comment="A-A=0" >}}
{{< /book/sourceCode >}}

<p class="mt-3">
    The downside to the above options is that they also affect the flags.
    However, they are only 1 byte long not 2 and are both 3 T-states faster.
</p>

<h2>Inverting A</h2>
<p>
    If inverting A, i.e. swapping each bit from 1 to 0 and vis-versa then instead of <code>XOR 0xFF</code> use
    <code>CPL</code> instead. It's both faster, 1 byte and that's all that instruction does.

{{< book/asm op="CPL" code="2F" comment="This instruction does exactly the same thing and nothing else!" >}}

<p class="mt-3">
    The downside is that <code>CPL</code> does not affect the flags whilst <code>XOR</code> does.

    Writing code on an 8-bit microcomputer requires a skill that has been lost in the modern programming era.
    These days, developers are used to having Gigabytes of memory and processors that run at multiple Gigahertz.
</p>
<p>
    In the microcomputer era we had far, far less resources.
    Processor clocks ran at 2 or 4 MHz, one thousandth of the clock speed of modern processors.
    If we were lucky we had 32K, 48K or 64K of memory to play with and that was it.
</p>
<p>
    Because of this, we had to learn pretty quickly how to optimise our code to fit into memory.
    If we were lucky we could use a floppy disk to page in parts of the program as needed,
    but even then when a Cassette tape was the primary medium for a platform that wasn't even possible.
</p>
<p>
    Optimisations at the machine code level would be a balance of reducing the size of code and having code run as fast
    as possible.
</p>
<p>
    Sometimes you might sacrifice some memory for speed if the routine is important, for example it's doing a transform
    for some graphics in real time, but most of the time it's to reduce the memory used.

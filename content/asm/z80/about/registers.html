<h3>Accumulator and Flag registers</h3>
<p>
    The Z80 provides two independent 8-bit accumulators each with an associated flag register.
    The programmer can switch between the two pairs with the
    <a href="../../opcodes/ex/exafaf/">EX AF, AF'</a> instruction.
</p>

<h3>General Purpose registers</h3>
<p>
    Two matched sets of general purpose registers are available, each set containing six 8-bit registers:
    B, C, D, E, H and L.
</p>
<p>
    These registers are also arranged to provide 3 16-bit registers:
    BC, DE and HL.
</p>
<p>
    The HL register pair is usually used for addressing memory and has more instructions available to it for
    this purpose than BC or DE register pairs.
</p>
<p>
    The programmer can switch between the main (BC, DE and HL) and alternate (BC', DE' and HL') set of general purpose registers with the
    <a href="../../opcodes/ex/exx/">EXX</a> instruction.
</p>

<h3>PC Program Counter</h3>
<p>
    The program counter holds the 16-bit address of the current instruction being fetched from memory.
    The Program Counter is automatically incremented after its contents are transferred to the address lines.
    When a program jump occurs, the new value is automatically placed in the Program Counter, overriding the incrementer.
</p>

<h3>SP Stack Pointer</h3>
<p>
    The stack pointer holds the 16-bit address of the current top of a stack located anywhere in external system RAM.
    The external stack memory is organized as a last-in first-out (LIFO) file.
    Data can be pushed onto the stack using the <a href="../../opcodes/stack/push/">PUSH</a> instructions
    or popped off of the stack using the <a href="../../opcodes/stack/pop/">POP</a> instructions.
</p>

    The Z80 is an 8-bit microprocessor introduced by Zilog as the startup company's first product.
    The Z80 was conceived by Federico Faggin in late 1974 and developed by him and his 11 employees starting in early 1975.
    The first working samples were delivered in March 1976, and it was officially introduced on the market in July 1976.
    With the revenue from the Z80, the company built its own chip factories and grew to over a thousand employees over the following two
    years.

    The Zilog Z80 is a software-compatible extension and enhancement of the Intel 8080 and, like it, was mainly aimed at
    embedded systems.
    Although used in that role, the Z80 also became one of the most widely used CPUs in desktop computers and home computers from the 1970s to the mid-1980s.
    It was also common in military applications, musical equipment such as synthesizers (like the Roland Jupiter-8),
    and coin operated arcade games of the late 1970s and early 1980s including Pac-Man.

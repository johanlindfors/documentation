<h2>General pins</h2>
<h3>A<sub>0</sub>&hellip;A<sub>15</sub> Address Bus</h3>
<p>
    Address Bus (output, active High, tristate).
    A0&hellip;A15 form a 16-bit Address Bus, which provides the addresses for memory data bus
    exchanges (up to 64 KB) and for I/O device exchanges.
</p>

<h3>D<sub>0</sub>&hellip;D<sub>7</sub> Data Bus</h3>
<p>
    D<sub>0</sub>&hellip;D<sub>7</sub> constitute an 8-bit bidirectional data bus, used for data exchanges with memory
    and I/O.
</p>

<h3><span class="not">CLK</span> Clock (input)</h3>
<p>
    Single-phase MOS-level clock.
</p>

<h2>Bus Control</h2>
<h3><span class="not">BUSACK</span> Bus Acknowledge</h3>
<p>
    The <span class="not">BUSACK</span> pin indicates to the requesting device that the CPU address bus, data bus and
    control signals <span class="not">MREQ</span>, <span class="not">IORQ</span>, <span class="not">RD</span> and <span
        class="not">WR</span>
    have entered their high-impedance states and other devices on the bus can control those lines.
</p>

<h3><span class="not">BUSREQ</span> Bus Request</h3>
<p>
    <span class="not">BUSREQ</span> contains a higher priority than NMI and is always recognized
    at the end of the current machine cycle.
</p>
<p>
    <span class="not">BUSREQ</span> forces the CPU address bus, data bus, and
    control signals <span class="not">MREQ</span>, <span class="not">IORQ</span>, <span class="not">RD</span> and <span
        class="not">WR</span>
    to enter a high-impedance state so that other devices can control these lines.
    <span class="not">BUSREQ</span> is normally wired OR and requires an external pull-up for these applications.
</p>
<p>
    Extended <span class="not">BUSREQ</span> periods due to extensive DMA operations can prevent the CPU from properly
    refreshing dynamic RAM.
</p>

<h2>System Control</h2>
<h3><span class="not">M1</span> Machine Cycle One (output, active Low)</h3>
<p>
    <span class="not">M1</span>, together with <span class="not">MREQ</span>, indicates that the
    current machine cycle is the op code fetch cycle of an instruction execution.
    <span class="not">M1</span>, when operating together with <span class="not">IORQ</span>, indicates an interrupt
    acknowledge cycle.
</p>

<h3><span class="not">MREQ</span> Memory Request (output, active Low, tristate)</h3>
<p>
    <span class="not">MREQ</span> indicates that the address bus holds a valid address for a memory read or a memory
    write operation.
</p>

<h3><span class="not">IORQ</span> Input/Output Request (output, active Low, tristate)</h3>
<p>
    <span class="not">IORQ</span> indicates that the lower half of the address bus holds a valid I/O address for an I/O
    read or write operation.
    <span class="not">IORQ</span> is also generated concurrently with <span class="not">M1</span> during an interrupt
    acknowledge cycle to indicate that an interrupt response vector can be placed on the data bus.
</p>

<h3><span class="not">RD</span> Read (output, active Low, tristate)</h3>
<p>
    <span class="not">RD</span> indicates that the CPU wants to read data from memory or an I/O device.
    The addressed I/O device or memory should use this signal to gate data onto the CPU data bus.
</p>

<h3><span class="not">WR</span> Write (output, active Low, tristate)</h3>
<p>
    <span class="not">WR</span> indicates that the CPU data bus contains valid data to be stored at the
    addressed memory or I/O location.
</p>

<h3><span class="not">RFSH</span> Refresh (output, active Low)</h3>
<p>
    <span class="not">RFSH</span>, together with <span class="not">MREQ</span>, indicates that the lower seven bits of
    the system’s address bus can be used as a refresh address to the system’s dynamic memories.
</p>

<h2>CPU Control</h2>
<h3><span class="not">HALT</span> HALT State (output, active Low)</h3>
<p>
    <span class="not">HALT</span> indicates that the CPU has executed a <code>HALT</code> instruction and is waiting for
    either a nonmaskable or a maskable interrupt (with the mask enabled) before operation can resume.
    During <span class="not">HALT</span>, the CPU executes <code>NOP</code>s to maintain memory refreshes.
</p>

<h3><span class="not">WAIT</span> WAIT (input, active Low)</h3>
<p>
    <span class="not">WAIT</span> communicates to the CPU that the addressed memory or I/O devices are not ready for a
    data transfer.
    The CPU continues to enter a <span class="not">WAIT</span> state as long as this signal is active.
    Extended <span class="not">WAIT</span> periods can prevent the CPU from properly refreshing dynamic memory.
</p>

<h3><span class="not">INT</span> Interrupt Request (input, active Low)</h3>
<p>
    An Interrupt Request is generated by I/O devices.
    The CPU honors a request at the end of the current instruction if the internal software-controlled interrupt enable
    flip-flop (IFF) is enabled.
    INT is normally wired-OR and requires an external pull-up for these applications.
</p>

<h3><span class="not">NMI</span> Nonmaskable Interrupt (input, negative edge-triggered)</h3>
<p>
    <span class="not">NMI</span> contains a higher priority than <span class="not">INT</span>.
    <span class="not">NMI</span> is always recognized at the end of the current instruction, independent of the status
    of the interrupt enable flip-flop, and automatically forces the CPU to restart at location 0066h.
</p>

<h3><span class="not">RESET</span> Reset (input, active Low)</h3>
<p>
    <span class="not">RESET</span> initializes the CPU as follows:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>it resets the interrupt enable flip-flop,</li>
    <li>clears the Program Counter and registers I and R,</li>
    <li>sets the interrupt status to Mode 0.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    During reset time, the address and data bus enter a high-impedance state, and all control output signals enter an
    inactive state.
    <span class="not">RESET</span> must be active for a minimum of three full clock cycles before a reset operation is
    complete.

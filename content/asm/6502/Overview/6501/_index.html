<p>
    The MOS Technology 6501 was a variant of the 6502 and released at the same time in 1975.
</p>
<p>
    It was pin compatible with the Motorola 6800 whilst the more popular 6502 had a different layout to support an
    on-chip oscillator.
</p>
<p>
    Both processors could work with the 6800 processor's support chips.

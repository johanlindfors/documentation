<p>
  The JSR & RTS instructions allows for subroutines to be implemented.
  The work by utilising 2 bytes on the stack consisting of the address before the next instruction to execute when the
  subroutine returns - not the actual address of that instruction.
</p>

<p>
  On the 16-bit 65816 there are the JSL & RTL instructions.
  These use 3 bytes on the stack. The extra byte is the return bank address.
  Like RTS the address on the stack is the address before the next instruction not the actual instruction
</p>

<p>
  For Interrupt routines there's the RTI instruction. That instruction is on the Interrupt page.
</p>

<div class="printPageBreakAvoid">
  <h2 class="subsubsection" id="JSR">JSR - Jump to Subroutine</h2>
  <p>
    Transfer control to a subroutine, pushing the return address onto the stack.
    The 16-bit address placed on the stack is the address of the 3rd byte of the instruction, not the address of the
    next instruction.
  </p>
  <div class="marginNote">
    Some assemblers recognise JSR as an alternate to the 65816 JSL instruction where if the address is greater than
    &FFFF then the 24 bit JSL instruction is used instead.
  </div>
  <p>
    Subroutines called by JSR must return using the RTS instruction.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="printPageBreakAvoid">
  <h2 class="subsubsection" id="RTS">RTS - Return from Subroutine</h2>
  <p>
    Returns from a subroutine called by JSR.
    It pulls the 16-bit program counter from the stack, incrementing it by one so that the next instruction is the one
    immediately after the calling JSR instruction.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="printPageBreakAvoid">
  <h2 class="subsubsection" id="JSL">JSL - Jump to Subroutine Long</h2>
  <p>
    Transfer control to a subroutine, pushing the return address onto the stack.
    The 24-bit address placed on the stack is the address of the 4th byte of the instruction, not the address of the
    next instruction.
  </p>
  <p>
    Subroutines called by JSL must return using the RTL instruction.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="printPageBreakAvoid">
  <h2 class="subsubsection" id="RTL">RTL - Return from Subroutine Long</h2>
  <p>
    Returns from a subroutine called by JSL.
    It pulls the 24-bit program counter from the stack, incrementing it by one so that the next instruction is the one
    immediately after the calling JSL instruction.
  </p>

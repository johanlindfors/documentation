<p>
  The branch instructions perform a test against one of the processor's flags.
  Depending on the instruction a branch is taken if it is either clear or set.
</p>
<p>
  If the branch is taken, a 1-byte signed displacement in the second byte of the instruction is sign-extended to 16-bits
  and added to the Program Counter.
  If the branch is not taken then the instruction immediately following the 2-byte instruction is executed.
</p>
<p>
  The allowable range of the displacement is -128 to +127 from the instruction immediately following the branch.

  <h2>BCC - Branch if Carry Clear</h2>
  <p>
    BCC tests the Carry flag and branches if it is clear.
  </p>
  <p>
    It can be used in several ways:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Test the result of a shift into the carry</li>
    <li>Determine if the result of a comparison is <em>less than</em></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Some assemblers accept <strong>BLT</strong> <em>(Branch if Less Than)</em> as an alternate mnemonic for
    <strong>BCC</strong>.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="printPageBreakAvoid">
  <h2>BCS - Branch if Carry Set</h2>

  <p>
    BCS tests the Carry flag and branches if it is set.
  </p>
  <p>
    It can be used in several ways:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Test the result of a shift into the carry</li>
    <li>Determine if the result of a comparison is <em>greater than or equal</em></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Some assemblers accept <strong>BGE</strong> <em>(Branch if Greater Than or Equal)</em> as an alternate mnemonic for
    <strong>BCS</strong>.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="printPageBreakAvoid">
  <h2>BEQ - Branch if Equal</h2>
  <p>
    BEQ tests the Zero flag and branches if it is set.
  </p>
  <p>
    It can be used in several ways:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Test the result of a comparison is equal</li>
    <li>Test the result of an Increment or Decrement operation is zero, useful in loops.</li>
    <li>Test the value just loaded is zero</li>
    <li>Test the result of an arithmetic operation is zero</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="printPageBreakAvoid">
  <h2>BNE - Branch if Not Equal</h2>
  <p>
    BNE tests the Zero flag and branches if it is clear.
  </p>
  <p>
    It can be used in several ways:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Test the result of a comparison is not equal</li>
    <li>Test the result of an Increment or Decrement operation is not zero</li>
    <li>Test the value just loaded is not zero</li>
    <li>Test the result of an arithmetic operation is not zero</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="printPageBreakAvoid">
  <h2>BMI - Branch if Minus</h2>
  <p>
    BMI tests the Negative flag and branches if it is set.
    The high bit of the value most recently affected will set the N flag.
    On 8-bit operations this is bit 7.
    On 16-bit operations (65816 only) this is bit 15.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is normally used to determine if a two's-complement value is negative but can also be used
    in a loop to determine if zero has been passed when looping down through zero
    (the initial value must be positive)
  </p>
</div>

<div class="printPageBreakAvoid">
  <h2>BPL - Branch if Positive</h2>
  <p>
    BPL tests the Negative flag and branches if it is clear.
    The high bit of the value most recently affected will set the N flag.
    On 8-bit operations this is bit 7.
    On 16-bit operations (65816 only) this is bit 15.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is normally used to determine if a two's-complement value is positive
    or if the high bit of the value is clear.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="printPageBreakAvoid">
  <h2>BVC - Branch if Overflow Clear</h2>
  <p>
    BVC tests the Overflow flag and branches if it is clear.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the 6502 only 3 instructions alter the overflow flag: ADC, SBC & CLV.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the 65C02 the BIT instruction also alters the overflow flag.
  </p>
  <p>
    The PLP & RTI alter the flags as they restore all flags from the stack.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the 65816 the SEP & REP instructions modify the v flag.
  </p>
  <p>
    On some processors there's a Set Overflow hardware signal available,
    but on many systems there is no connection to that pin.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="printPageBreakAvoid">
  <h2>BVS - Branch if Overflow Set</h2>
  <p>
    BVS tests the Overflow flag and branches if it is set.
    It has the same limitations as the BVC instruction.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  The branch instructions sets the Program Counter to a new value from which the next instruction will be taken.
</p>

<h2 class="subsubsection">JMP - Jump to location</h2>
<p>
  The program counter is loaded with the target address. If a long JMP is executed the bank is loaded from the third
  byte of the address.
</p>
<div class="marginNote">
  Some assemblers accept <strong>JML</strong> as an alternate mnemonic for <strong>JMP long</strong>.
</div>

<h2 class="subsubsection">BRA - Branch Always</h2>
<p>
  A branch is always taken, no test is performed. It is equivalent to a JMP instruction, except that as it
  uses a signed displacement it is only 2 bytes in length instead of 3 for JMP.
  In addition, because it uses displacements, code using BRA is relocatable.
</p>
<div class="marginNote">
  BRA was introduced with the 65C02 processor.
</div>
<p>
  The 1-byte signed displacement in the second byte of the instruction is sign-extended to 16-bits
  and added to the Program Counter.
  If the branch is not taken then the instruction immediately following the 2-byte instruction is executed.
</p>
<p>
  The allowable range of the displacement is -128 to +127 from the instruction immediately following the branch.
</p>

<h2 class="subsubsection">BRL - Branch Always Long</h2>
<p>
  A branch is always taken, no test is performed. It is equivalent to a BRA instruction, except that
  BRL is a 3 byte instruction. The two bytes after the opcode form a 16-bit signed displacement
  from the Program Counter.
</p>
<div class="marginNote">
  BRL was introduced with the 65802 processor.
</div>
<p>
  The allowable range of the displacement is anywhere within the current 64K program bank.
</p>
<p>
  The advantage of BRL is that it makes code relocatable,
  although it is 1 cycle slower than the absolute JMP instruction.

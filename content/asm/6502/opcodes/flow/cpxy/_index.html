<p>
  The CPX & CPY instructions subtracts the data at the address in the operand from the contents of the relevant index register,
  setting the n, z & c flags based on the result.
  The register & Memory are unaffected by this operation.
</p>
<p>
  The primary use of the CPX or CPY instructions is to test the value of the index register against loop boundaries.
</p>

<h3>Data size</h3>
<p>
  On all processors, the data added from memory is 8-bit.
  However, for 16-bit processors with the m flag is clear then the data added is 16-bit
  with the low-order 8-bits at the effective address and the high-order 8-bits at the effective address plus one.

<p>
  This instruction is the only means to shift a 65802 or 65812 processor between 6502 emulation mode and full 16-bit native mode.
</p>
<h2>Switch to native 16-bit mode</h2>
<p>To switch into native mode, clear the carry bit then invoke XCE</p>
{{< highlight go "linenos=inline" >}}
.goNative
    CLC      ; Clear Carry to indicate native mode
    XCE      ; Processor will be in 16-bit native mode once this completes
    RTS      ; Carry will now set if we were originally in emulation or clear if already native.
{{< / highlight >}}
<p>
  Once XCE has completed and the processor is in native mode, the following would have occurred.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>bit 5 of the flags stops being the b break flag. It's now the x mode select flag</li>
  <li>bit 6 is now the m memory mode flag (it's unused in 6502 emulation mode)</li>
  <li>Both x & m are set to 1</li>
</ul>

<h2>Switch to 6502 emulation mode</h2>
<p>To switch into 6502 emulation mode, set the carry bit then invoke XCE</p>
{{< highlight go "linenos=inline" >}}
.goEmulation
    SEC      ; Set Carry to indicate native mode
    XCE      ; Processor will be in 16-bit native mode once this completes
    RTS      ; Carry will now set if we were already in emulation or clear if we were originally native.

<p>
  Once XCE has completed and the processor is in 6502 emulation mode, the following would have occurred.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The x & m flags are lost from the status register.</li>
    <li>bit 6 is unavailable as it's unused in 6502 emulation mode</li>
    <li>The accumulator is forced into 8-bit's, the high 8 bits are in the hidden B accumulator</li>
    <li>The index registers are forced into 8-bits. The high 8-bits are lost.</li>
    <li>The stack pointer is forced into page 1, losing the high byte of the address.</li>
</ul>

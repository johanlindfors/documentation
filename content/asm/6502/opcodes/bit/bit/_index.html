<p>
  Bit is a dual-purpose instruction which performs operations against the accumulator and memory.
  It is usually used immediately preceding a conditional branch instruction
</p>
<div class="marginNote">
  For 8-bit processors n has the value of bit 7 and v the value of bit 6 of the memory location.
</div>
<p>
  First it set's the n flag to reflect the value of the high bit of the data in memory
  and the v flag to the next-to-highest bit of that data.
</p>
<div class="marginNote">
  For 16-bit processors, when m=0, n has the value of bit 15 and v the value of bit 14 of the memory location.
</div>
<p>
  Second it performs a logical AND of the memory and the accumulator.
  If the result is zero the z flag is set.
</p>
<p>
  In both operations, the contents of the accumulator and memory are not modified.

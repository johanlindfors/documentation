  <h2>TRB - Test & Reset memory against Accumulator</h2>
  <p>
    TRB logically AND's the <em>complement</em> of the accumulator with the data at an address and stores the result in
    that address.
  </p>
  <p>
    This has the effect of clearing each memory bit which is set in the accumulator, leaving the other bits unchanged.
  </p>

  <p>
    The z flag is set based on a different operation. It's set if the memory location once set logically AND the
    accumulator (not it's compliment) is zero.
  </p>

  <p>
    For 8-bit processors or when m=1, the values in the accumulator & memory are 8-bit.
  </p>
  <p>
    For 16-bit processors, when m=0, the values in the accumulator & memory are 16-bit.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="printPageBreakAvoid">
  <h2>TSB - Test & Set memory against Accumulator</h2>
  <p>
    TSB is identical to TRB except it sets the bits defined in the Accumulator not reset them.

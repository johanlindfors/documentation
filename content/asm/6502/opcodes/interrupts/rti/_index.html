<p>
  The RTI instruction is used at the end of an interrupt handler.
  It pulls both the status register and program counter from the stack.
  For 16bit processors running in native mode it also pulls the program bank register from the stack.

<p>
  Unlike RTS, the address on the stack is the actual return address.
  (RTS expects it to be the address before the next instruction).

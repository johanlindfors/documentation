<p>
  BRK forces a software interrupt. It is unaffected by the i interrupt disable flag.
</p>
<p>
  The BRK instruction is a single byte instruction. However, when it is invoked the Program Counter is incremented by 2.
  This allows for a one-byte signature value indicating which break caused the interrupt.
</p>
<p>
  Even if the signature byte is not required, it must either be there or the RTI instruction which returns control
  to the caller must manually decrement the return address.
  As this can be tricky, most operating systems require BRK to take up 2 bytes in memory.
</p>

<h3>6502, 65C02 & Emulation Mode (e=1)</h3>
<p>
  The program counter is incremented by two & pushed onto the stack.
  The status register (with b break flag set) is pushed onto the stack.
  The interrupt disable flag is then set, disabling interrupts.
  The program counter is loaded with the interrupt vector at &FFFE-&FFFF.
</p>
<p>
  It's up to the interrupt handler pointed to by (&FFFE) to test the b flag to determine if the interrupt was from
  a software (BRK) rather than a hardware (IRQ) interrupt.
</p>
{{< highlight go "linenos=inline" >}}
.handler PLA       ; copy status from stack
         PHA       ; but don't remove it else RTI will break

         AND #&10  ; check B flag
         BNE isBrk ; call break handler

.isIRQ             ; hardware handler here
         RTI       ; exit hardware handler

.isBrk             ; break handler here
         RTI       ; exit BRK handler

<h3>65802/65816 Native Mode (e=0)</h3>
<p>
  The program bank register is pushed onto the stack.
  The program counter is incremented by two & pushed onto the stack.
  The status register is pushed onto the stack.
  The interrupt disable flag is then set, disabling interrupts.
  The program counter is loaded with the break vector at &00FFE6-&00FFE7.
</p>

<h3>Decimal Mode</h3>
<p>
  On the 6502 the decimal d flag is not modified after a BRK is executed.
  On the 65C02 & 65816 the decimal d flag is reset to 0.
</p>

  - op: "ADDX"
    format: "1101R1S00Mr"
    syntax:
      - "ADDX Dy, Dx"
      - "ADDX -(Ay), -(Ax)"
    datasize:
      - Byte
      - Word
      - Long
    flags:
      "X": "Set the same as the carry bit"
      "N": "Set if the result is negative; cleared otherwise"
      "Z": "Cleared if the result is nonzero; unchanged otherwise"
      "V": "Set if an overflow occurs; cleared otherwise"
      "C": "Set if a carry is generated; cleared otherwise"
      "note":
        Normally, the Z condition code bit is set via programming before the start of an operation.
        This allows successful tests for zero results upon completion of multiple-precision operations.
    action: "Source + Destination + X \\longrightarrow Destination"

<p>
  Adds the source operand and the extend bit to the destination operand and
  stores the result in the destination location. The operands can be addressed in two
  different ways:
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Data register to data register</dt>
  <dd>The data registers specified in the instruction contain the operands.</dd>
  <dt>Memory to memory</dt>
  <dd>The address registers specified in the instruction address the operands using the predecrement addressing mode.</dd>
</dl>
<p>
  The size of the operation can be specified as byte, word, or long.

  - op: "ABCD"
    format: "1100R10000Mr"
    syntax:
      - "ABCD Dy, Dx"
      - "ABCD -(Ay), -(Ax)"
    datasize: Byte
    flags:
      "X": "Set the same as the carry bit"
      "Z": "Cleared if the result is nonzero; unchanged otherwise"
      "C": "Set if a decimal carry was generated; cleared otherwise"
      "note":
        Normally, the Z condition code bit is set via programming before the start of an operation.
        This allows successful tests for zero results upon completion of multiple-precision operations.
    action: "Source_{10} + Destination_{10} + X \\longrightarrow Destination"

<p>
  Adds the source operand to the destination operand along with the extend bit,
  and stores the result in the destination location. The addition is performed using binary-coded decimal arithmetic.
  The operands, which are packed binary-coded decimal
  numbers, can be addressed in two different ways:
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Data Register to Data Register</dt>
  <dd>The operands are contained in the data registers specified in the instruction</dd>
  <dt>Memory to Memory</dt>
  <dd>
    The operands are addressed with the predecrement addressing mode using the address registers specified in the
    instruction.
  </dd>
</dl>
<p>This operation is a byte operation only.</p>
